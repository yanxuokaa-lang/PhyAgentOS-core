# Forge Configuration Reference

> Applies to PhyAgentOS 1.0.0 and the unified Forge Gateway Tool API.

## 1. Location and naming

The default file is `~/.PhyAgentOS/config.json`. `paos onboard` creates or refreshes it. `paos agent` and `paos gateway` accept `--config` and `--workspace` for the active instance.

Pydantic models accept camelCase and snake_case; onboarding writes camelCase. A root-level `runtime` field is explicitly rejected:

```text
legacy `runtime` configuration is unsupported; remove it and configure `forge`
```

Legacy Forge execution selectors (`enabled`, `baseUrl`, and `apiVersion`, including snake_case
forms) are also rejected. Runtime selection and the Gateway URL come from an installed Skill
manifest and an explicitly started profile.

## 1.1 `agents.defaults` context budget

| JSON field | Type | Default | Constraint and meaning |
|:-----------|:-----|:--------|:-----------------------|
| `contextWindowTokens` | integer | `272000` | Hard model-request window used by AgentLoop prompt admission. |
| `contextCompactionTriggerTokens` | integer | `260000` | Starts deterministic prompt rebuilding and persistent-history consolidation before the hard window; must be smaller than `contextWindowTokens`. |
| `requestTimeoutS` | number | `180.0` | Timeout for each provider attempt; independent of whole-turn timeout and context compaction. |

Before every model call, AgentLoop projects the current Coordinator-owned AgentTask,
exposes only Forge wrappers relevant to the current lifecycle phase, and estimates the
complete request including Tool schemas. At the trigger it removes older chat history
already represented by the task projection and compacts completed Forge results while
retaining task, revision, scene, calibration, entity, geometry, evidence, binding, and
invocation references. SQLite records, Gateway results, and Session history are not
rewritten. Prompt admission reserves `maxTokens` for the response, so the effective input
limit is `contextWindowTokens - maxTokens`; a request that remains above that input limit
fails locally before provider transport.

An older configuration that sets only `contextWindowTokens` remains supported; its
compaction trigger is derived at 95 percent of that custom window.

## 2. `forge`

| JSON field | Type | Default | Constraint and meaning |
|:-----------|:-----|:--------|:-----------------------|
| `requestTimeoutS` | number | `10.0` | HTTP request timeout, greater than zero. |
| `pollIntervalS` | number | `0.5` | Recommended Action/Session reconciliation interval in `[0.1, 5.0]` seconds. |
| `executionTimeoutS` | number | `300.0` | Default Agent-side task deadline guidance. It does not prove that a timed-out execution stopped. |
| `evidence` | object | below | AgentTask best-effort before/after capture settings. |

PAOS invokes Query, Action, and Session only through `/tools` and `/invocations`. It does not call
legacy `/agent/sessions` or `/policy/command` routes. Concurrency is decided by the selected
endpoint operation's `max_concurrency`.

## 2.1 `resourceRegistry`

| JSON field | Type | Default | Constraint and meaning |
|:-----------|:-----|:--------|:-----------------------|
| `url` | string | `https://paos-resource-manager.dev.x-era.com` | HTTP(S) Resource Registry. `PAOS_RESOURCE_REGISTRY_URL` overrides it; an empty value permits only local bundles or an explicit static index. |

The Registry is queried only by explicit `paos skill search/install/update` or `paos forge-node
install` commands. Starting PAOS never downloads a Skill.

## 3. `forge.evidence`

| JSON field | Type | Default | Constraint and meaning |
|:-----------|:-----|:--------|:-----------------------|
| `requiredImageSources` | string[] | `[]` | Global image sources. Non-empty task sources take precedence; when both are empty, discover runtime-context readiness. |
| `captureTimeoutS` | number | `5.0` | Maximum pre-POST wait for a before snapshot. |
| `postCaptureTimeoutS` | number | `5.0` | Maximum wait for higher sequences after observed Gateway terminal state. |
| `connectionTimeoutS` | number | `2.0` | Timeout for each WebSocket connection attempt. |
| `maxArtifactBytes` | integer | `8388608` | Maximum decoded image or state-message entity size. |
| `associationQuality` | literal | `best_effort` | The implemented PAOS observation-association quality. |

Source precedence:

```text
task.verification.evidence_policy.required_sources (non-empty)
    > forge.evidence.requiredImageSources
```

## 4. `agents.verification`

| JSON field | Type | Default | Constraint and meaning |
|:-----------|:-----|:--------|:-----------------------|
| `serviceEnabled` | boolean | `true` | Starts the independent service. Non-`off` tasks require it to be available. |
| `model` | string/null | `null` | Uses `agents.defaults.model` when null. |
| `provider` | string/null | `null` | Auto-matched from verifier model when null; explicit value must exist in providers. |
| `timeoutS` | number | `180.0` | Per-model-call verification timeout. |
| `evidenceRetention` | enum | `none` | `all | failed | none`. |
| `maxReplansPerEpisode` | integer | `2` | Maximum additional PlanRevisions in one AgentTask; non-negative. |
| `maxVerifierCallsPerRun` | integer | `50` | Verifier-call budget for this PAOS process. Zero disables this code-level budget. |
| `replanTimeoutS` | number | `120.0` | Deadline for beginning a requested PlanRevision. |
| `serviceHost` | string | `127.0.0.1` | Child HTTP-service bind host. |
| `servicePort` | integer | `8100` | Range `1..65535`; use distinct ports for multiple local PAOS instances. |

Verification Service readiness is bounded. A non-`off` AgentTask is rejected when the service is unavailable.

## 5. `agents.evolution`

| JSON field | Type | Default | Constraint and meaning |
|:-----------|:-----|:--------|:-----------------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Enables explicit Skill activation, the experience ledger, and background evolution. Failures never block task execution. |
| `scope` | literal | `verified_forge_lineage` | Consumes AgentTask lineages with semantic verdicts; the persisted literal remains stable for compatibility. |
| `promotionMode` | literal | `guarded_auto` | Allows only validated, guarded automatic promotion. |
| `minSuccessfulEpisodes` | integer | `3` | Independent successful AgentTasks required for one candidate; at least 1. |
| `minLessonEpisodes` | integer | `3` | Independent workflow-related failed AgentTasks required before a clustered Lesson can activate; at least 1. |
| `maxLessonsPerSkill` | integer | `8` | Scoped lessons returned by one `activate_skill` call; range `1..50`. |
| `maxEvolutionCallsPerRun` | integer | `20` | Background reflection budget, separate from verifier calls; zero disables the code-level limit. |
| `model` | string/null | `null` | Inherits the verification model, then the Agent default model. |
| `provider` | string/null | `null` | Inherits the verification provider, then auto-matches the selected model. |

When enabled, the legacy root `LESSONS.md` is preserved but is not injected globally or read by Forge verification. Skill-bound lessons are loaded on demand from the ledger and projected to `skills/<name>/references/LESSONS.md`. The applicable active set returned by explicit Skill activation is frozen with the AgentTask and supplied to automatic verification, later PlanRevisions, and review only as non-authoritative advice. It cannot establish a criterion or replace evidence; tasks without activated Skills supply no learned Lessons. Failures unrelated to the workflow remain diagnostic-only; related failures are normalized and clustered before activation. Thresholds count distinct AgentTasks, not PlanRevisions, reviews, duplicate events, or replays.

The evolution model/provider is resolved independently of the verifier call budget:

```text
agents.evolution.model
  → agents.verification.model
  → agents.defaults.model

agents.evolution.provider
  → agents.verification.provider
  → provider inferred from the selected model
```

`enabled=false` disables episode reflection and promotion. `activate_skill` remains available as the
explicit workflow-loading and Forge binding gate. Existing experience data and Skill sidecars are
not modified or deleted.

## 6. AgentTask and Tool API tools

`forge_task_create` accepts `task_description` and the verification contract below. It returns a
PAOS `task_id`, an initial immutable PlanRevision, and a frozen primary Skill binding. Task creation
requires the current turn's primary `activate_skill` ID and revalidates its Runtime candidate.
`forge_tool_query` may run without a task for diagnostics; Action and task-owned Session calls
require the `task_id` and contribute to task verification.

Task lifecycle tools are `forge_task_create`, `forge_task_get`, `forge_task_begin_revision`,
`forge_task_finalize`, and `forge_task_cancel`. Tool transport tools are `forge_tool_context`,
`forge_tool_query`, `forge_tool_start_action`, `forge_tool_action_status`,
`forge_tool_action_result`, `forge_tool_cancel_action`, `forge_tool_start_session`,
`forge_tool_session_status`, `forge_tool_session_result`, and `forge_tool_stop_session`.

`binding_id`, `task_id`, `revision_id`, execution record ID, PAOS `caller_id`, Gateway
`invocation_id`, and Gateway `attempt_id` are distinct identities. Only one AgentTask may be
non-terminal globally. A recovery revision keeps
the same task ID and is limited by `maxReplansPerEpisode` and `replanTimeoutS`.

## 7. `TaskVerificationContract`

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|:------|:-----|:--------|:--------|
| `mode` | enum | `off` | `off | audit | enforce | recovery`. |
| `goal` | string | `""` | Required and trimmed for non-`off`. |
| `success_criteria` | string[] | `[]` | At least one non-blank item for non-`off`. |
| `constraints` | string[] | `[]` | Restrictions preserved during verification and recovery. |
| `evidence_policy` | object | semantic default | Evidence requirements. |

### `evidence_policy`

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|:------|:-----|:--------|:--------|
| `profile` | string | `semantic_default` | Generic label; does not select action-specific code. |
| `required_kinds` | string[] | `["rgb_image"]` | Each kind must exist in before and after. `robot_state` requires `/ws/state`. |
| `required_sources` | string[] | `[]` | Every source must exist for image kinds in both phases. |
| `minimum_association` | enum | `best_effort` | `best_effort | authoritative`; current PAOS collection supplies best-effort evidence. |

## 8. Mode behavior matrix

| Condition | `off` | `audit` | `enforce` | `recovery` |
|:----------|:------|:--------|:----------|:-----------|
| Goal/criteria required | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Best-effort Evidence Bundle | Yes for bound Actions | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Missing before blocks Tool API Action | No | No | No | No |
| Verifier error | N/A | Record; preserve execution terminal | Failed | Failed |
| `inconclusive` | N/A | Record; preserve execution terminal | Failed | Failed |
| `replan_required` | N/A | No recovery | Failed | `awaiting_replan` |

## 8.1 Skill Runtime controls

Skill Runtime paths are managed by PAOS data-path helpers rather than additional config fields.
Use `paos skill search/install/update/remove/list/inspect/start/status/switch/logs/stop` for Bundle and
Runtime lifecycle and `paos forge-node install/verify <skill-name> <node-id>` for independently
locked nodes. Pass `--archive <path>` to install a separately obtained Node without Registry
access. Starting a profile requires Dora CLI on `PATH` (v0.4.1 with `dora-message` v0.7.0 is the
current Forge Skill compatibility baseline), validates required binaries, assets, environment
variables, Gateway `/tools`, and all manifest `required_tools`. RuntimeManager starts local Dora
services when needed. An active
Runtime's manifest `gateway_url` is the Tool API URL used by the Agent.

`paos skill start <name> --profile <profile> --env-file <path>` reads an operator-owned UTF-8
`KEY=VALUE` deployment file. It does not invoke a shell or expand variables; blank lines and leading
`#` comments are ignored, while duplicate keys and invalid names fail before launch. Precedence is
manifest `environment` < environment file < current process environment. The merged result is used
for required-environment preflight, Bundle `start.sh`, the Dora coordinator, and the flow without
being written to Runtime state. Machine paths, model caches, and external qualification references
may live in this file; inject API keys and other secrets separately through a restricted operator
environment. Do not place deployment files in the PAOS-managed `forge_runtime/environments`
directory or package real host values in a Skill or Node.

## 9. `embodiments`

Embodiment config describes knowledge topology, not execution adapters:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|:------|:--------|:--------|
| `mode` | `single` | `single | fleet`. |
| `sharedWorkspace` | `~/.PhyAgentOS/workspaces/shared` | Agent shared workspace in fleet mode. |
| `instances` | `[]` | Robot knowledge profiles. |

Instance fields: `robotId` and `workspace` are required; `enabled=true`; `profileName` and `sharedEnvironment` are optional. Extra fields are forbidden, so legacy `driver` fields must be removed.

## 10. Recommended configurations

### 10.1 Execution-chain smoke use

```json
{
  "forge": {
    "requestTimeoutS": 10,
    "executionTimeoutS": 300
  },
  "agents": {
    "verification": {
      "serviceEnabled": false
    },
    "evolution": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration permits only tasks with `verification.mode=off`; an installed Skill Runtime
must still be started explicitly.

### 10.2 Long-running verified use

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "verification": {
      "serviceEnabled": true,
      "model": "openrouter/openai/gpt-4o-mini",
      "provider": "openrouter",
      "timeoutS": 180,
      "evidenceRetention": "failed",
      "maxReplansPerEpisode": 2,
      "maxVerifierCallsPerRun": 50,
      "replanTimeoutS": 120,
      "serviceHost": "127.0.0.1",
      "servicePort": 8100
    },
    "evolution": {
      "enabled": true,
      "scope": "verified_forge_lineage",
      "promotionMode": "guarded_auto",
      "minSuccessfulEpisodes": 3,
      "minLessonEpisodes": 3,
      "maxLessonsPerSkill": 8,
      "maxEvolutionCallsPerRun": 20,
      "model": null,
      "provider": null
    }
  },
  "forge": {
    "requestTimeoutS": 10,
    "pollIntervalS": 0.5,
    "executionTimeoutS": 300,
    "evidence": {
      "requiredImageSources": ["front"],
      "captureTimeoutS": 5,
      "postCaptureTimeoutS": 5,
      "connectionTimeoutS": 2,
      "maxArtifactBytes": 8388608,
      "associationQuality": "best_effort"
    }
  },
  "resourceRegistry": {
    "url": "https://paos-resource-manager.dev.x-era.com"
  }
}
```

## 11. Configuration checks

```bash
paos status
paos agent -m "Call forge_tool_context for the requested Tool and report its schema, binding, readiness, and frame profile. Do not execute an Action."
```

`paos status` checks local config, workspace, model, and provider. It does not replace live Tool inspection through `forge_tool_context`.
