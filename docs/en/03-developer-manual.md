# PhyAgentOS Developer Manual

[中文](../zh/03-developer-manual.md) · [Documentation index](../README.md)

> Documentation version: 1.0.0.

## 1. Development invariants

1. Robot or simulator execution has one physical path: `ForgeToolClient → Gateway Tool API → ToolEndpoint → Dora → robot/simulator`.
2. AgentTask aggregates planning, evidence, and verdicts; it never executes the robot.
3. `binding_id`, `task_id`, `revision_id`, record ID, `caller_id`, `invocation_id`, and `attempt_id` are distinct.
4. Forge ToolResult and invocation events are authoritative execution facts.
5. Action/Session admission, cancel/stop acceptance, timeout, and `unknown` do not prove physical stop.
6. General Agent tools, verification, experience, evolution, and dynamic MCP remain independent.
7. Runtime artifacts are installed only after bounded archive and digest verification.
8. PAOS core and public Skills remain provider-neutral; RoboTwin, SAPIEN, task, embodiment, and
   benchmark configuration belong to the Gateway/ToolEndpoint adapter and profile.

## 2. Module map

| Module | Responsibility |
|:-------|:---------------|
| `agent/loop.py` | Existing Agent loop, general tools, dynamic MCP, Forge tool registration, context, and lifecycle |
| `agent/tools/forge_tool_api.py` | Governed Query/Action/Session Tool API Agent wrappers |
| `agent/tools/forge_task.py` | Five AgentTask lifecycle tools |
| `forge/tool_client.py` | Strict asynchronous HTTP client and response validation |
| `forge/binding.py`, `forge/task.py` | Immutable Runtime/ToolSpec binding, AgentTask models/store, evidence, verification, and recovery |
| `forge/observation.py`, `forge/evidence.py` | Best-effort image/state collection and artifact writing |
| `skill_runtime/` | Manifest, catalog, safe archive, installer, Registry, state, Runtime manager, and availability |
| `agent/experience/` | Activation, episodes, assessment, Lessons, Skill candidates, and evolution |
| `verification/` | Public task, evidence, request, and verdict contracts plus verification service |

## 3. Forge Tool API client

`ForgeToolClient` accepts only JSON object envelopes with `ok=true` and object-valued `data`.
Errors preserve HTTP status, error code, retryability, and any returned invocation identity.

| Operation | HTTP contract |
|:----------|:--------------|
| List Tools | `GET /tools` → 200 |
| Read ToolSpec | `GET /tools/{tool_id}` → 200 |
| Read context | `GET /tools/{tool_id}/context` → 200 |
| Invoke Query | resolve ToolSpec, then `POST /tools/{endpoint_id}/{operation}:invoke` → 200 |
| Admit Action | `POST /tools/{tool_id}:invoke` → 202 |
| Action status | `GET /invocations/{invocation_id}` → 200 |
| Action result | `GET /invocations/{invocation_id}/result` → 200 or pending 202 |
| Request cancel | `POST /invocations/{invocation_id}/cancel` → 200 or accepted 202 |
| Admit Session | `POST /tools/{tool_id}:invoke` → 202 |
| Stop Session | `POST /invocations/{invocation_id}/stop` → 200 or accepted 202 |

Path components are percent-encoded. PAOS supplies `caller_id` and persists it with the intent
before Action/Session admission. Admission must contain a non-empty `invocation_id`; Action also
requires `attempt_id`. A timeout leaves an unknown record and recovery never repeats the POST.

## 4. Agent-facing tools

Task lifecycle:

- `forge_task_create(task_description, verification, activation_id)`;
- `forge_task_get(task_id)`;
- `forge_task_begin_revision(task_id, reason)`;
- `forge_task_finalize(task_id)`;
- `forge_task_cancel(task_id, reason?)`.

Tool transport:

- `forge_tool_context(tool_id)`;
- `forge_tool_query(tool_id, arguments, task_id?, timeout_ms?)`;
- `forge_tool_start_action(task_id, tool_id, arguments, timeout_ms?)`;
- `forge_tool_action_status(task_id, invocation_id)`;
- `forge_tool_action_result(task_id, invocation_id)`;
- `forge_tool_cancel_action(task_id, invocation_id)`;
- `forge_tool_start_session(task_id, tool_id, arguments, ownership)`;
- `forge_tool_session_status/result/stop_session(task_id, invocation_id)`.

Diagnostic Query and bound calls invoke the same HTTP methods. Every mutating or task-attributed
wrapper validates ownership and the frozen Tool binding before network access. Tool wrappers must
never invent a Gateway identity or result.

## 5. AgentTask contracts and transactions

`AgentTaskRecord` contains a stable ID, task description, `TaskVerificationContract`, status,
append-only PlanRevisions, evidence references, verification attempts, cancellation state, and
timestamps. Each `PlanRevision` contains its own Tool records, verdict, and verification attempts.

`AgentTaskStore` uses SQLite WAL and `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`. Creation queries for any non-terminal task
inside the same transaction, enforcing one global active slot across processes. Updates write the
complete validated record and an append-only event. Callers do not modify tables directly.

Node prompts expose field catalogs, counts, references, and small identity
summaries for direct-predecessor or explicitly selected evidence records, not
large geometry payloads. `forge_plan_select.argument_sources` names a visible
record and exact catalogued path; Coordinator resolves the complete value and
validates the final object against the frozen Consumer ToolSpec before it
persists the selection.

Terminal task states are `succeeded`, `failed`, and `cancelled`. Non-terminal states are
`executing`, `cancelling`, and `awaiting_replan`. Tool status `unknown` is terminal for aggregate
accounting but is a failure, not evidence of stop.

## 6. Bound execution lifecycle

1. Activate the primary Skill and freeze its Runtime/ToolSpec candidate into AgentTask revision 1.
2. On the first bound physical execution, perform best-effort before-capture.
3. Invoke Query or admit Action/Session through ForgeToolClient.
4. Persist caller intent before admission and then retain Gateway invocation/attempt references.
5. Update asynchronous records only from authoritative status/result responses.
6. After every task-owned execution is terminal, perform after-capture on finalize.
7. Aggregate Tool records, evidence, and the task contract for verification.
8. Persist task and revision verdicts; schedule one terminal experience episode.

Once a record is terminal, later observations do not rewrite it. Cancellation responses are
stored, but `requested` or `accepted` leaves the task in `cancelling` until reconciliation and
explicit finalization.

## 7. Verification and recovery

`TaskVerificationContract` remains the public user-level contract. The verifier receives goal,
criteria, constraints, the frozen Skill binding, PlanRevisions, ToolExecutionRecords, Gateway
terminal results, before/after evidence, task history, and frozen Skill-scoped advisory Lessons.

In recovery mode, a valid `replan_required` verdict moves the task to `awaiting_replan` with a
deadline. `begin_revision` checks the same `task_id`, replan budget, deadline, and task state, then
appends a revision. Earlier attempts remain visible to experience analysis. Verifier exceptions are
persisted as failed attempts; audit preserves execution semantics, while enforce/recovery fail.

### 7.1 Capability outcome projection

The generic verification layer may project a terminal Action's versioned
`capability_outcome_summary_v1` into `capability_outcome_projections` in the verifier
context. This is an `execution_fact_only` view: it preserves the capability phase,
failure ownership, unknown status, bounded metric names, and optional post-release
evidence while keeping Gateway artifact references opaque. Malformed, unsupported, or
status-mismatched summaries are reported as bounded projection errors and are not used
as task evidence. The projection always carries `task_success_authorized=false`; only
the user-level `TaskVerificationContract`, its evidence policy, and the verifier may
produce a task verdict. The projection performs no Gateway call, motion admission,
retry, or PlanRevision mutation.

## 8. Evidence and retention

Evidence paths are workspace-relative and written atomically. Before semantic verification, the
bundle identity, association quality, completeness, capture window, and required kinds and sources
are checked. Retained artifacts are then validated for path containment, byte size, SHA-256, media
type, and structured JSON where applicable. The evidence bundle records capture quality and errors
rather than presenting best-effort collection as authoritative.

Retention can remove entity bytes according to policy, but it must preserve the task record,
execution references, bundle metadata, and tombstone information required for audit.

## 9. Skill Runtime contracts

A `skill.yaml` manifest must use `manifest_version: 2`, a directory-safe name/version, a relative
Skill document, an HTTP(S) `gateway_url`, non-empty required Tools, at least one profile, and strict
known fields. Registry-resolved nodes require artifact identity, version, platform, architecture,
archive type, one root executable entrypoint, and SHA-256.

Archive validation rejects absolute/traversing paths, links, duplicate/colliding paths, oversized
files, expansion-limit violations, missing inventory entries, and digest mismatches. Skill and Node
installers stage content, validate it, then atomically replace the target with rollback support.

RuntimeManager:

1. resolves the installed Skill and profile;
2. materializes the locked environment without mutating installed nodes; its digest covers the
   exact dataflow path and SHA-256 of every regular file beside that dataflow;
3. checks the Dora CLI, dataflow, required files, and environment;
4. refuses to adopt an unmanaged Gateway already using the address;
5. persists `starting` and runs the optional Bundle start hook as
   `bash <bundle>/start.sh <name> <version>` with inherited stdio;
6. checks the local Dora services, runs `dora up` when needed, and starts the named flow;
7. waits for flow, `GET /tools`, and all required Tool contexts;
8. persists running/failed/stopped state and lifecycle logs.

Dataflow rendering resolves `FORGE_RUNTIME_BIN`, `PAOS_SKILL_ROOT`, `PAOS_SKILL_NAME`, and
`PAOS_SKILL_VERSION`; the two Skill identity values are also supplied to Dora process environments.
Start, stop, Skill install/update commit, and removal share a non-blocking per-Skill cross-process
lock. Status preserves `starting` while that lock proves startup is still active, while a stale
unlocked `starting` state is reconciled normally.

The current Forge Skill compatibility baseline is Dora CLI v0.4.1 with `dora-message` v0.7.0.
RuntimeManager requires compatible command behavior but does not enforce an exact semantic version;
operators must prevent a mismatched coordinator/daemon from being reused. Dora is a host runtime
prerequisite, not a Python dependency and not part of a Skill Bundle.

A normal stop is rejected while non-terminal invocations, Sessions, or task bindings remain
tracked. Force stop records an audit event and does not change invocation truth.

## 10. Registry and availability

Artifacts require an expected size and SHA-256 before entering the cache. Static indexes provide
both values directly. A Registry Node may omit its duplicate digest and size fields: the verified
Skill lock supplies the expected digest, and the client resolves the size from Registry metadata or
the direct-download endpoint. Any Registry digest that is present must match the lock. Resumed
downloads are verified again before installation. An empty Registry URL permits only local bundles
or an explicit static index. `PAOS_RESOURCE_REGISTRY_URL` overrides `resourceRegistry.url`.
The public Registry lookup is name-based. A requested CLI version is validated against the
downloaded Skill manifest before Node resolution rather than appended to the Registry URL.

`discover_active_runtime` reconciles persisted state, Dora flow, Gateway health, and required Tool
contexts. Its availability provider flows through SkillsLoader, ExperienceCoordinator, and
SkillActivationManager. Skill discovery order is workspace, installed, built-in.

## 11. Experience and evolution integration

All Agent tool calls remain recorded. Frozen binding/version fields attach AgentTask, revision,
invocation, and attempt references. The outcome source
maps each revision verdict to its last execution record so a recovered task preserves both failed
and successful semantic attempts.

Generated Lessons and Skill updates remain subject to redaction, scope, support thresholds,
abstraction checks, managed-block replacement, atomic writes, reload validation, and rollback.
Evolution failures remain fail-open.

## 12. Extension workflows

To add a robot capability:

1. publish a provider-neutral Query, Action, or Session ToolSpec with exact schemas and binding;
2. implement or package the ToolEndpoint operation and define its `max_concurrency` in Gateway;
3. use the Fake Gateway to test binding drift, context, route, invocation, pending, terminal,
   cancel/stop, ownership, and unknown outcomes;
4. for a simulator, implement an `EnvironmentAdapter` and provider ports in the independent runtime for the
   generic Gateway/ToolEndpoint to call, and keep RoboTwin/SAPIEN task, embodiment, and benchmark settings in
   its adapter/profile; simulator actor/entity truth, segmentation, metadata, and internal poses are comparison
   facts only and must not replace sensor observations or real perception providers;
5. add the locked Node and Dora profile references to a manifest-v2 Bundle, then let RuntimeManager
   start the flow and wait for `/tools` plus every required Tool context;
6. add provider-neutral workflow guidance to a Skill without embedding simulator names, task-specific
   coordinates, provider payloads, or secrets;
7. perform simulation or hardware acceptance only after the complete runtime and Tool contexts are ready.

An Agent-composed PlanNode must be independently completable by one frozen Tool
candidate. Publish a composite capability only when one Tool owns its complete
terminal effect; otherwise express the workflow as dependent atomic nodes. Tool
producers remain reusable and consumer-neutral: the Agent selects structured
facts according to the consumer's frozen input schema.

Do not create a second PAOS execution protocol, direct Agent-to-Dora/SDK calls, simulator-bound Skill
names, or a cross-Tool lease.
A new Agent tool is justified only when the generic task and Tool API tools cannot express the
capability.

## 13. Test gates

### Manipulation and benchmark extension boundary

Long-horizon pick-and-place dependencies are expressed by the Skill-scoped,
read-only `WORKFLOW_DAG` projection. It does not create PlanRevisions, execute
Tools, or hold cross-Tool leases. `AgentTaskRecord`, `PlanRevision`, SQLite, and
`AgentTaskCoordinator` remain the sole lifecycle authority.

RoboTwin/Franka embodiment, benchmark, route frame, proposal-to-execution-grasp
adaptation, `object_T_tcp`, workspace, joint/stop policies, and route geometry
belong in adapter profiles. Readiness workers produce only IK/collision/route/
limit/stop evidence; probes record before/after and bounded observed outcomes;
`ForgeTaskVerifier` owns user-level success. Replacing a robot changes the
profile/adapter and evidence, not the Skill or PAOS core.

```bash
ruff check PhyAgentOS tests
python -m compileall -q PhyAgentOS tests
pytest -q
```

Tests should cover response contracts, Session ownership, pending/cancel/stop/timeout/unknown
semantics, one active task, diagnostic Query, immutable bindings, no-POST recovery, revision
recovery, evidence, version-scoped episodes, archive attacks, transactional rollback, Registry
verification, Runtime health/switching, and mocked workflows. Concrete hardware/simulator tests are
conditional on independently installed matching artifacts and Dora availability.
