## 1. Choose the integration point

| Capability | Integration point |
|:-----------|:------------------|
| Robot read or calculation | Gateway Query ToolSpec + ToolEndpoint operation |
| Robot effect | Gateway Action ToolSpec + ToolEndpoint operation |
| Stateful capability lifecycle | Gateway Session ToolSpec + ToolEndpoint operation |
| Dora nodes and deployment assets | Manifest-v2 Skill Bundle and locked Node artifacts |
| Simulator/external provider integration | generic capability runtime + EnvironmentAdapter/provider ports + Dora profile; the Bundle freezes wiring and artifact references only |
| Workflow instructions | `SKILL.md` discovered by SkillsLoader |
| User-task success | Generic `TaskVerificationContract` and AgentTask finalize |
| New model provider | Existing provider registry/configuration |
| Non-robot Agent capability | Existing Agent ToolRegistry or dynamic MCP |

Do not connect Agent code directly to robot SDKs, Dora nodes, simulators, or legacy Gateway
Session/Policy routes outside the governed Tool API.

### RoboTwin 2.0 boundary and execution order

RoboTwin 2.0 is an independent simulation/benchmark runtime at the end of the physical execution
plane. It is not a PAOS provider and it does not define Skill business semantics. PAOS v1.0 still uses an
independent generic capability runtime. The single `pick-place-workflow` Skill describes the complete seven-Tool
workflow and publishes only provider-neutral ToolSpecs and workflow guidance. The EnvironmentAdapter/profile
owns RoboTwin tasks, SAPIEN, embodiment, benchmark, and vendor-SDK parameters. Dora profiles and locked Node
artifacts only wire that runtime into the governed Tool API. Simulation actor/entity truth, segmentation, object
metadata, and internal poses are comparison facts only; real deployment must use sensor artifacts and an
independent perception provider.

Use this order:

1. Define a simulator-neutral ToolSpec (`query|action|session`, strict schemas, frame/unit, and readiness).
2. Use the Fake Gateway to verify `/tools`, contexts, binding, routes, and error semantics.
3. In an independent generic capability runtime with no simulator dependency, implement the generic
   ToolEndpoint lifecycle, provider ports, result projection, and failure semantics.
4. In the independent RoboTwin 2.0 environment, implement an `EnvironmentAdapter` and provider ports
   consumed by the generic runtime/Gateway, and keep RoboTwin task, SAPIEN, embodiment, and benchmark
   configuration inside the adapter/profile. Actor/entity truth, segmentation, object metadata, and internal
   poses are simulation comparison facts only; they must not replace sensor observations or real perception providers.
   Adapter dependencies, RoboTwin/SAPIEN/Torch/YOLO packages, and simulator assets must live in the separate
   adapter environment and external directories; they must not enter the PAOS wheel or control-plane `pyproject.toml`.
5. Provide locked Nodes and Dora-profile wiring through a manifest-v2 Skill Bundle and start it with Skill Runtime.
6. Wait for the Dora flow, Gateway `/tools`, and every `required_tools` context to become ready before simulation acceptance.
7. Keep Agent calls on `ForgeToolClient → Gateway Tool API → ToolEndpoint → Dora → robot/simulator`.
   Do not create a simulator-bound Skill such as `robotwin2-pick-place-workflow`, or connect directly to an SDK,
   Dora, or simulator.

## 2. Define a ToolSpec

Every ToolSpec has a stable `tool_id`, implementation and endpoint binding, operation,
`semantics: query|action|session`, description, strict input/output JSON schemas, readiness requirements,
and a robot frame profile when spatial inputs are involved.

```yaml
tool_id: motion.resolve_relative_pose
implementation_id: motion.integration
endpoint_id: motion.relative_pose
operation: resolve
semantics: query
description: Resolve a relative end-effector delta into an absolute target pose.
input_schema:
  type: object
  additionalProperties: false
  required: [translation_frame, translation_m]
  properties:
    translation_frame: {enum: [tcp, base]}
    translation_m:
      type: object
      additionalProperties: false
      required: [x, y, z]
      properties:
        x: {type: number}
        y: {type: number}
        z: {type: number}
output_schema:
  type: object
robot_frame_profile:
  base_frame: arm_base
  tool_frame: tcp
```

Use Query for synchronous reads or deterministic resolution without a robot effect. Use Action for
bounded physical effects and Session for explicitly owned, stateful lifecycles. Define Endpoint operation `max_concurrency` at
the execution owner; PAOS does not create a cross-Tool lease.

## 3. Implement Query, Action, and Session behavior

Query calls are resolved from ToolSpec and invoked at:

```text
POST /tools/{endpoint_id}/{operation}:invoke → HTTP 200
```

Action admission uses:

```text
POST /tools/{tool_id}:invoke → HTTP 202 + invocation_id + attempt_id
GET  /invocations/{invocation_id}
GET  /invocations/{invocation_id}/result
POST /invocations/{invocation_id}/cancel
```

Session admission uses the same `POST /tools/{tool_id}:invoke` contract. Reconcile it through the
common invocation routes and stop it with `POST /invocations/{invocation_id}/stop`. Declare whether
the Session is task-owned, shared, or runtime-owned; do not let one owner stop another owner's
Session.

Action status/result must expose an explicit lifecycle. Result may remain pending with HTTP 202.
Cancellation acceptance reports control handling only. When execution truth cannot be recovered,
return an explicit unknown outcome rather than fabricating cancellation or success.

Inputs and outputs must be finite JSON and satisfy ToolSpec. Spatial Tools must state frames,
units, tolerances, and orientation behavior. Avoid hidden defaults that the Agent cannot inspect
through `forge_tool_context`.

## 4. Build a manifest-v2 Skill Bundle

An installed Skill Bundle contains:

```text
<skill>/
├── skill.yaml
├── SKILL.md
├── start.sh                    # optional external-resource preparation before Dora
├── archive-manifest.json       # generated by the packaging script
├── profiles/<profile>/dataflow.yaml
├── profiles/<profile>/...
└── assets/...
```

Minimal manifest structure:

```yaml
manifest_version: 2
name: example-skill
version: "1.0.0"
description: Example robot workflow.
skill_document: SKILL.md
gateway_url: http://127.0.0.1:19002
required_tools: [example.query, example.action]
profiles:
  sim:
    dataflow: profiles/sim/dataflow.yaml
    required_binaries: [gateway, example_node]
    required_assets: [assets/scene.xml]
    required_environment: []
    environment: {}
artifacts:
  resolver: registry
  nodes:
    gateway:
      artifact_id: gateway-1.0.0-linux-x86_64
      version: "1.0.0"
      platform: linux
      arch: x86_64
      artifact_type: executable_tar_gz
      entrypoint: gateway
      sha256: <64-character-sha256>
```

All paths are relative and contained by the Bundle. Each Node archive has the locked SHA-256 and
contains exactly one root-level executable with the locked filename; the installer records the
extracted binary hash in its receipt. The Bundle archive inventory must
cover every file with SHA-256. Links, path traversal, collisions, oversized expansion, and unlisted
content are rejected.

When startup must download weights or prepare other external resources, the Bundle may provide a
root-level `start.sh`. PAOS invokes it as `bash <bundle>/start.sh <name> <version>`, preserves the
caller's working directory, and inherits terminal stdio. The script should resolve Bundle files
relative to its own location, tolerate repeated execution, and return non-zero on failure. Such a
Bundle requires Bash on the host `PATH`. `PAOS_SKILL_NAME` and `PAOS_SKILL_VERSION` are available as
dataflow placeholders and in Dora process environments.

### 4.1 Runtime deployment environment

`required_environment` declares external deployment inputs; it is not a persistence location for
their values. Machine-specific Python interpreters, Runtime roots, checkpoints, caches, and
qualification paths belong in an operator-owned UTF-8 `KEY=VALUE` file passed explicitly with
`paos skill start --env-file <path>`. The file does not execute a shell or expand variables; blank
lines and comments beginning with `#` are ignored. Precedence from lowest to highest is manifest
`profile.environment`, the environment file, and the current launch-process environment.
RuntimeManager uses the same merged result for preflight, optional `start.sh`, the Dora coordinator,
and the flow, without writing environment names or values to Runtime state.

The environment file is deployment configuration for one PAOS instance. Place it beside that
instance configuration under `deployments/<profile>/runtime.env`; do not place it in the
RuntimeManager-owned `forge_runtime/environments` directory or commit host-specific values. A
repository or Bundle may provide a `.example` template containing names only. Inject API keys and
other secrets separately through an operator secret store or restricted environment; they must not
enter a Skill, Node, dataflow, log, trace, or evolution experience.

```bash
paos skill start example-skill \
  --profile sim \
  --env-file ~/.PhyAgentOS/deployments/sim/runtime.env
```

## 5. Package, publish, and close the local loop

### 5.1 Build and validate a Bundle

The repository script regenerates `archive-manifest.json`, builds a deterministic archive with
fixed metadata, and safely extracts it through `ArchiveValidator` for final verification:

```bash
python scripts/package_skill.py /path/to/example-skill --output-dir dist/skills
```

The output name comes from `name` and `version` in `skill.yaml`; the script prints the archive
SHA-256 and byte size. It refuses to replace an existing output unless `--force` is supplied; use
that option only before publication. The script rejects links and excludes version-control, cache,
and `node_modules` directories. Do not put credentials, presigned URLs, machine caches, logs, or
runtime state in the source directory.

Before upload, run the same public local loop that users depend on:

```bash
paos skill install dist/skills/example-skill-1.0.0.tar.gz --local
paos forge-node verify example-skill gateway
paos skill inspect example-skill
paos skill start example-skill --profile sim
paos skill status example-skill
paos skill stop example-skill
```

A local Bundle uses the same archive, manifest, and Node-lock validation as a Registry Bundle.
Missing Nodes still resolve through the configured Registry or static index. Installers stage,
validate, atomically replace, and roll back on failure. Never require callers to disable digest
verification.

### 5.2 Immutable publication order

1. Publish and register every Node artifact first. Each `executable_tar_gz` archive contains only
   one root-level executable named by `entrypoint`; put the final archive SHA-256 in the Skill lock.
2. Freeze the `skill.yaml` name/version, profiles, and Node locks, package the Bundle, and retain the
   printed Bundle SHA-256 and `size_bytes`.
3. Upload the Bundle to a non-overwritable, long-lived HTTPS object key. Read it back from the final
   URL and verify size and SHA-256. Corrections require a new version instead of overwriting bytes.
4. Register the current Skill name, URL, SHA-256, and size in the Resource Registry, and ensure every
   Node `artifact_id` resolves through its Node endpoint. An equivalent schema-v3 static index is
   also supported.
5. From a clean PAOS HOME, repeat Registry install, start, status, and stop. Confirm that no source
   checkout path or development-machine cache is required.

The public Registry returns the current Skill entry by name and has no historical-version subpath.
The version in `paos skill install <name> --version <version>` is a client constraint: after the
Bundle download, PAOS verifies its manifest version and rejects a mismatch before Node download or
installation commit. Preserve old versions through immutable URLs, static indexes, or local
archives; do not treat `--version` as a Registry history query.

## 6. Design the Dora profile

Develop and validate the currently distributed Forge Skill profiles with Dora CLI v0.4.1 and
`dora-message` v0.7.0. Keep Node builds on that protocol generation until the Skill locks and host
baseline are upgraded together.

The dataflow should give each node explicit inputs/outputs and use the Gateway Tool request/response
ports declared in its profile. Required executables are resolved from the immutable Runtime
environment. Assets remain in the Skill Bundle and are referenced with relocatable paths.

RuntimeManager creates a deterministic flow name, verifies Dora and required files, starts the
flow, then waits for Gateway `/tools` and every required Tool context. A Gateway already listening
at the manifest URL is not silently adopted.

When Tool API is the physical execution plane, disable the Gateway Agent API in the profile:

```yaml
agent:
  enabled: false
tools:
  enabled: true
```

## 7. Write workflow guidance

### 7.1 Stop That Shit / Anti-OverDefense scope gate

Before editing, ask whether the user explicitly requested the change, whether it is necessary for the current result, and whether reachable evidence proves that need. Extend only when all three are true; otherwise do not add hashes/SHA, frozen contracts, baselines, gates, speculative hardening, unnecessary dependencies, or repeated audits. Only an explicit `change` request permits edits; `review`, `answer`, and `monitor` are read-only by default. Do not remove existing safety measures. Put gates only at irreversible, cross-system, safety, or formal-release boundaries, and do not let prechecks displace real code execution, simulation, or measurement.

`SKILL.md` should tell the Agent when to activate the Skill, which contexts to inspect, the Query →
Action/Session ordering, task binding, ownership, terminal reconciliation, verification checkpoints, and safe recovery
rules. It must not embed secrets, Registry URLs, task-specific coordinates, or instructions to
bypass Gateway/verification.

For a verified workflow, activate the primary Skill in the current turn, create one AgentTask from
that activation, bind every contributing Query/Action/Session to the same task, finalize after all
task-owned executions terminate, and append a PlanRevision only when recovery verdict
allows it.

## 8. Evidence and verification

Robot capability integration should expose Tool execution facts, not action-specific verifier code.
PAOS captures configured image/state sources and applies the generic verification contract at
AgentTask finalize. Tool output schemas should contain useful terminal result semantics, final
state/error data, and tolerances where relevant.

If authoritative evidence is introduced later, version the evidence contract explicitly. Do not
upgrade best-effort WebSocket association by convention.

## 9. Fake Gateway and conformance tests

Before real hardware or simulation, use a mock HTTP transport to test:

- Tool list/spec/context and Query binding resolution;
- activation candidate revalidation and ToolSpec/runtime drift rejection;
- Action HTTP 202 admission with invocation and attempt identities;
- Session admission, ownership, status/result, and stop;
- pending status/result and known terminal results;
- cancellation requested/accepted without false stop;
- timeout and unknown without blind retry;
- endpoint concurrency rejection behavior;
- diagnostic Query and bound calls through identical routes;
- AgentTask one-active constraint, revisions, evidence, and aggregate verification;
- archive traversal/link/collision/digest attacks and transactional rollback;
- startup with and without `start.sh`, missing Bash, and non-zero hook exit;
- Skill identity injection into dataflow/Dora environments and rematerialization after profile
  content or dataflow-path changes;
- cross-process start/stop/install/remove conflicts for one Skill;
- Runtime start/status/log/stop and availability propagation.

Then run a complete simulated workflow. Real robot or MuJoCo acceptance must identify the exact
Bundle, node digests, profile, and environment used.

## 10. Integration acceptance checklist

- [ ] Tool semantics and schemas are explicit and strict.
- [ ] Frame, unit, tolerance, and readiness conventions are inspectable.
- [ ] Gateway operation owns `max_concurrency`.
- [ ] Query, Action, and Session use the documented HTTP contracts.
- [ ] Skill/Runtime/ToolSpec binding is frozen and revalidated for every governed execution.
- [ ] Invocation and attempt IDs remain separate from PAOS task IDs.
- [ ] Cancel, stop, timeout, and unknown do not imply physical stop or trigger a blind POST retry.
- [ ] Bundle and Node artifacts have immutable size/digest metadata.
- [ ] The Bundle passes repository packaging and the local install loop, and Registry Skill and Node
      endpoints all resolve.
- [ ] Optional startup-hook arguments, failure state, repeated execution, and external-resource
      digests are verified.
- [ ] Runtime profile starts from a clean environment and reaches all Tool contexts.
- [ ] Gateway Agent API is disabled for the Tool-only profile.
- [ ] General Agent tools, verification, experience, and evolution require no capability-specific fork.
