# Jevsome Projects

> Open-source projects that **provably call** Jev, TypeSafe AI's System One model. Every entry links to the line of code that proves it. Browse: [jevsome.ozersubasi.com](https://jevsome.ozersubasi.com)

**58 verified projects · 702 more in the JSON · 1,512 search hits examined · refreshed 2026-09-18**

Deliberately short. Jev is days old and the ecosystem is mostly two-day-old experiments; this list starts with what can be shown to be real and grows from there. The bar is the same for every entry, and it is written down.

## How an entry gets here

1. **Discovery.** GitHub code and repository search, run against the API surface itself. Nothing is copied from another list.
2. **Proof.** The matching file is downloaded and the matching *line* is located and read. A call to `/v1/systemone`, an SDK import, a pinned `jev-latest` route or a declared dependency counts. A README sentence, a comment, a changelog entry, or a `package.json` whose own name happens to contain "jev" does not.
3. **Classification.** Keyword rules against the section definitions below. The Jev path is wired up and takes over once a `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` is configured.
4. **Subject, not support.** The repository exists because of Jev: created after the model went public, or naming Jev or TypeSafe in its title, description or topics. Frameworks that predate Jev and added it as one provider among many are kept in the JSON as candidates, not listed here.
5. **Real code.** The proof line is source, not a mock, a recorded cassette or a data file.
6. **Five stars.** Someone besides the author cared. A presentation floor, not a correctness one; it is one number in [`pipeline/lib/quality.mjs`](pipeline/lib/quality.mjs) and will come down as the list matures.
7. **Health.** Stars, licence, last commit and demo links are re-checked daily.

Search casts a wide net — "typesafe" matches a lot of repositories that have nothing to do with Jev. Every hit that is not on the list is recorded in [`data/not-listed.json`](data/not-listed.json): 732 where no line of code calling Jev was found, 20 where it was found but the repository is not a project built on Jev. Argue with any of it.

## SDKs & clients

**In this section:** A library whose whole purpose is talking to the System One API from one language or runtime: request signing, typed Choice/Score/Noul answers, retries.

**Not here:** Applications that happen to ship a thin wrapper, and provider adapters that live inside a larger framework (those are integrations).

**Not here:** General applications that merely call a model, and browser automation (its own section).
