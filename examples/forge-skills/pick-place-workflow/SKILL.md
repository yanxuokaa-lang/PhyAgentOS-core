# Pick and Place Workflow

## Task Understanding and Multi-Object Execution

Use the user's natural-language goal, not a task-answer configuration. Activate
this Skill and create one AgentTask with the original goal, success criteria and
constraints. If the object inventory is unknown, leave the graph absent, perform
task-bound observation, capability discovery and scene understanding, then call
`forge_task_materialize_plan` with your selected semantic `nodes`. PAOS supplies
the graph identity and integrity metadata. Do not invent digests or executable
references. Preserve all discovery records in the same task.

Select entities and destinations from sensor-backed attributes and relations.
Resolve phrases such as "the left red object" against the observed scene; request
clarification or another observation when selection is ambiguous or a target is
missing. Never rewrite an entity or geometry reference to match a benchmark ID.
Calibrated named regions may be deployment data; which region serves this user's
goal is a task decision. Object count, order and goals must not come from a fixed
two-object template.

The graph represents your chosen obligations and dependencies. For sequential
relocations, require a fresh observation after the preceding placement before
planning the next object's motion. A final observation/verification obligation
joins all requested placements. Keep the original success criteria; do not
weaken them during recovery. Each node turn uses the task's activated Skill
instructions, not a later revision loaded silently during execution.

Use settled results and postcondition evidence to decide whether to advance.
For failure, choose stop, replay or replan from the facts. In PAOS, replay means
recomputing the reducer from existing records, not repeating a grasp. A new
physical attempt requires a new admitted plan revision. Unknown Action effects
must be reconciled by invocation ID before any retry. Final success requires
the existing task Verifier to evaluate all requested destinations in the last
observed scene, including legitimate recovery attempts.

## Capability Workflow

### Observed Destination Layout

For a requested row arrangement, discover `manipulation.layout` through the
installed Skill's Tool binding. Submit the ordered observation entity references,
the same observation/scene/calibration identities, an explicit supported world
axis, and the freshness limit. Never equate image-left with world+x without
calibration, invent destination references, or search Runtime-private files for
benchmark targets. If this Tool is absent from the bound Skill, report that
capability gap instead of using an unbound diagnostic Query to execute the task.

The Query returns scene-bound destination references, target geometry and explicit
observation-to-execution identity evidence. It does not grant motion or certify
support, workspace, collision-free relocation, or complete-route feasibility.
Use these references in Agent-selected semantic nodes and manipulation.prepare.
Occupied destinations may require an Agent-selected intermediate relocation; the
row Query does not generate a swap schedule or temporary destinations. If that
capability is needed but unavailable, stop or request a supported alternative.
After a placement, observe and understand again before generating a new layout;
do not carry observation entity IDs or stale destination references across scenes.
Final verification compares fresh observations with the original requested order,
not with a benchmark evaluator or the layout Query's available status.

This Skill describes one complete provider-neutral pick-and-place workflow. It is
not a scene-observation-only Skill: `scene.observe` and `scene.understand` are the
perception steps, `grasp.propose` and `manipulation.prepare` are non-mutating
planning/readiness steps, and `object.acquire` plus `object.place` are bounded
physical-effect Actions. The Skill does not implement any provider, simulator,
camera driver, robot SDK, or task-specific success rule.

Use `scene.observe` only to obtain measured observation artifacts. Before invocation,
read the ToolSpec and live context through `forge_tool_context`; use only the declared
sensor reference, frame, and freshness fields. A successful Query does not authorize
planning or motion and must not be passed directly to an Action.

The Query returns an explicit status, capture timestamp, scene revision, frame identity,
calibration reference, freshness measurement, and opaque artifact references. Treat
`unavailable`, `stale`, and `invalid` as blockers. Do not retry a stale or missing-
calibration result by weakening `max_age_ms`; obtain a new observation or operator input.

After a successful `scene.observe` result, the Agent may call
`manipulation.capabilities` or `scene.understand`; these are independent Query
nodes and may be called in either order or in parallel. For
`manipulation.capabilities`, pass the
observation reference, scene revision, and calibration reference unchanged. This
read-only Query returns the adapter-owned, scene-bound capability snapshot used to
reason about available arms and later assignment. It does not lease a resource,
run readiness, create an invocation, or authorize motion. Treat `unavailable`,
`stale`, and `invalid` as blockers, and preserve its opaque
`capability_snapshot_ref` for every downstream step.

Use `scene.understand` after a successful `scene.observe` result. It does not
depend on the capability Query. Pass the returned
`observation_ref`, scene revision, frame, calibration reference, freshness, and artifact
references unchanged. The understanding Query returns entity/relation claims and spatial
envelopes with confidence and provenance. It may also return opaque derived artifacts for
instance masks, object point clouds, and metric localization, but only when their observation,
entity, frame, calibration, source lineage, and root provenance bindings are complete. These
artifacts are Query evidence, not grasp candidates or motion authorization. Reject stale,
unavailable, ambiguous, or invalid results before any future Action.

Use `grasp.propose` only after both `scene.understand` and
`manipulation.capabilities` have returned successful terminal results. The Agent
may satisfy those two dependencies in either order or in parallel:

```text
scene.observe
  ├─ manipulation.capabilities ─┐
  └─ scene.understand ───────────┴─ grasp.propose
  -> manipulation.prepare
  -> object.acquire
  -> object.place
```

Pass the returned observation reference, scene revision, frame, calibration reference,
freshness, and target entity claims with their spatial envelopes unchanged. Never skip the
freshness, calibration, frame, or provenance checks. The proposal Query returns
provider-neutral grasp candidates with candidate identity, frame/calibration binding,
provenance, confidence, score, and bounded funnel evidence. Candidates are proposals only:
they are not IK-verified, not collision-free, and not action-admitted, and they must not be
sent directly to an Action. An `empty` result means no candidates exist for the targets; do
not fabricate or substitute default candidates and do not loosen thresholds or skip safety
checks to obtain candidates. Any further preparation must go through an independent
`manipulation.prepare` Query, and motion authorization stays with the Gateway/Runtime
admission path.

Use `manipulation.prepare` only after a successful `grasp.propose` result. Pass the
observation reference, scene revision, frame, calibration reference, freshness,
candidate-set reference, and complete candidate records unchanged. This Query is a
non-mutating readiness assessment with three explicit checks: `workspace`,
`kinematic`, and `collision`. Only candidates with all three checks reported as
`pass` can appear as `qualification: prepared`; rejected candidates are omitted and
an empty set is returned explicitly as `status: empty`.

Preparation evidence is not an IK guarantee, collision guarantee for a future
trajectory, or execution admission. Treat `stale`, `unavailable`, and `invalid` as
blockers. Never call `invoke_action` or start a Session with this Query, and never
interpret `motion_authorized: false` as permission to bypass the Gateway/Runtime
admission path.

Use `object.acquire` only after `manipulation.prepare` returned a selected prepared
candidate and the current Tool context is ready. Create one AgentTask binding and
pass the observation, scene, frame, calibration, candidate-set, preparation,
candidate, and entity references unchanged. Start it through
`forge_tool_start_action`, then reconcile the returned `invocation_id` with the
standard status/result routes. Admission is not completion; pending, cancellation
acceptance, timeout, and `unknown` do not prove a physical stop and must not be
blindly retried.

The bounded Action owns its internal approach/contact/close/lift/hold phases. Use
the terminal `capability_outcome_summary_v1` for phase attribution only after the
Gateway result is terminal. It is execution evidence, not a replacement for
`AgentTask finalize` or the generic verification contract.

Use `object.place` only after `object.acquire` is terminal with `status: succeeded`.
Pass the same observation, scene, frame, calibration, candidate-set, preparation,
candidate, and entity references, plus the acquire invocation reference and an
opaque `destination_ref`, unchanged into the place Action. A destination reference
does not expose coordinates, simulator fields, or controller parameters; its
meaning is resolved by the Gateway profile. Transport, descent, release, and
retreat are internal bounded phases. Reconcile the place invocation through the
standard status/result/cancel routes and treat cancellation acceptance and
`unknown` as physically uncertain.

The terminal place summary includes `post_release_evidence`, which reports only
typed artifact references and their availability. This evidence is required for
verification of the released object's destination state; a successful Action is
not by itself a user-level task verdict. Do not retry release blindly or infer
placement from an unverified acquire result.

For a long-horizon pick-and-place task, keep one AgentTask and one PAOS-owned
append-only PlanRevision across the complete sequence. The Skill exposes a
read-only semantic DAG projection (`WORKFLOW_DAG`) for dependencies and ready
nodes; it does not create revisions, hold resource leases, or execute Tools:

```text
observe -> {capabilities, understand} -> propose -> prepare -> acquire -> place
```

The workflow reducer is a replayable projection over existing Tool records. It
accepts only terminal Tool results and opaque references, rejects skipped steps or
cross-scene bindings, and exposes the next declared Tool without invoking a
Gateway. `failed`, `cancelled`, and `unknown` stop automatic progression. Reconcile
an unknown invocation by its existing ID; for a recoverable failure ask the PAOS
task coordinator to append a new PlanRevision, then rebind this projection to
that revision. Never create a second execution protocol or infer task success
from a single Action summary.

For a task whose objects must be decomposed or assigned dynamically, the Agent
may select `planning_mode=agent_composed` and submit semantic subtasks to
`compose_agent_plan`. The resulting PlanGraph describes obligations and
dependencies, not a hard-coded Tool sequence. For each ready node,
`DynamicToolPlanner.candidate_tools` returns all frozen Tool candidates matching
the node capability; the Agent chooses one and `DynamicToolPlanner.admit`
performs PAOS evidence, scene, capability, resource, and ToolSpec checks before
the caller invokes the normal AgentTask/ForgeToolClient path. This bridge does
not execute Tools, create revisions, hold leases, or authorize motion. The
`baseline` reducer remains available for deterministic replay.

When running through AgentLoop, activate a persisted agent-composed revision
with `forge_plan_activate`, then call `forge_plan_ready` before selecting a
Forge Tool. The AgentLoop registry guard rechecks the selected Tool's planning
projection and node binding; a missing or stale binding is returned as a
structured admission error. This bridge is read-only and does not replace the
Coordinator/Gateway execution or reconciliation path.
