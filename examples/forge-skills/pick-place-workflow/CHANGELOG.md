# Change Log

## v2.6.18 (2026-09-24) - codex

- [policy] [fix] [completed] Carry runtime-profile `scene.observe` defaults through the frozen ToolSpec so task-bound Query arguments are completed by the Coordinator.
- [policy] [fix] [完成] 将 runtime profile 的 `scene.observe` 默认值写入冻结 ToolSpec，由 Coordinator 补齐 task-bound Query 参数。
- [tests] [fix] [completed] Keep the bundle/package version assertion aligned with the v2.6.18 feature revision; Skill suite: 347 passed.
- [tests] [fix] [完成] 将 bundle/package 版本一致性断言同步到 v2.6.18 功能修订；Skill 全量测试 347 项通过。

## v0.10.1 (2026-09-05) - codex

- [policy] [refactor] [completed] Changed the canonical workflow from a linear
  capability order to a dependency DAG: `scene.observe` enables independent
  `manipulation.capabilities` and `scene.understand` Queries, and `grasp.propose`
  joins both results. The reducer exposes all ready Tools and never chooses the
  Agent's call order.
- [policy] [refactor] [完成] 将 canonical workflow 从线性能力顺序重构为依赖 DAG：
  `scene.observe` 后 `manipulation.capabilities` 与 `scene.understand` 独立 ready，
  `grasp.propose` 汇合两者结果。Reducer 暴露全部 ready Tool，不替 Agent 决定调用顺序。

### Verification

- The DAG/reducer versions are `pick_and_place_semantic_dag_v4` and
  `pick_and_place_workflow_v5`; the Skill manifest and package are `0.10.1`.
- The combined core/Skill/adapter regression, static checks, and no-motion boundary
  review are recorded in the repository changelog; no Gateway, Dora, Action, simulator
  motion, or hardware was started.

## v0.10.0 (2026-09-06) - codex

- [policy] [feat] [completed] Promoted `manipulation.capabilities` to an explicit
  no-motion node in the canonical seven-node DAG (`observe -> capabilities ->
  understand -> propose -> prepare -> acquire -> place`) and required its immutable
  capability snapshot reference in every downstream step.
- [policy] [feat] [完成] 将 `manipulation.capabilities` 提升为 canonical 七节点 DAG 中的
  显式 no-motion 节点（`observe -> capabilities -> understand -> propose -> prepare ->
  acquire -> place`），并要求所有后续节点保持不可变 capability snapshot 引用。

### Verification

- Combined core/Skill/adapter regression: `670 passed, 1 skipped`.
- Ruff, compileall, and `git diff --check` pass; no Gateway, Dora, Action, simulator motion,
  or hardware was started.
- The DAG and reducer versions are bumped to `pick_and_place_semantic_dag_v2` and
  `pick_and_place_workflow_v3`; the Skill manifest and package are `0.10.0`.

## v0.9.0 (2026-09-05) - codex

- [policy] [refactor] [completed] Added an immutable Skill-scoped semantic DAG
  projection and made the replay reducer derive admissible nodes from declared
  dependencies rather than tuple position. The state freezes DAG version/digest,
  exposes all ready nodes, validates branch joins and restored-state bindings, and
  remains separate from PAOS task persistence, Tool execution, and motion authority.
- [policy] [refactor] [完成] 新增不可变的 Skill-scoped 语义 DAG projection，并让
  replay reducer 根据声明式依赖而非 tuple 下标判断可执行节点。状态冻结 DAG
  version/digest、公开全部 ready nodes、校验分支汇合与恢复状态绑定，同时继续与
  PAOS 任务持久化、Tool 执行和运动授权分离。

### Verification

- Tests cover dependency and cycle rejection, immutable node/DAG digests, parallel
  ready-node projection, join blocking, restored-state tampering, required bindings,
  terminal failures, and revision rebinding.
- The DAG does not create `PlanRevision`, invoke Gateway/Action/Dora, acquire a robot
  lease, or grant readiness/task/motion verdicts.

## v0.8.0 (2026-09-03) - codex

- [sense] [feat] [completed] Extended the provider-neutral `scene.understand` result with
  auditable derived perception artifacts for instance masks, object point clouds, and metric
  localization, including strict observation/entity/frame/calibration/source/provenance binding.
- [sense] [feat] [完成] 扩展 provider-neutral `scene.understand` 结果，增加可审计的实例
  mask、目标点云和度量定位派生资产，并严格绑定 observation、entity、frame、calibration、
  source 与 provenance。

### Verification

- Generic runtime and Fake Gateway reject unknown kinds, duplicate/unbound/out-of-order lineage,
  mismatched observation/entity/frame/calibration, malformed descriptors, and provider-private
  fields without creating an Action or authorizing motion.
- RoboTwin adapter only forwards plain provider-neutral mappings; model, CUDA, simulator, and
  artifact materialization remain outside the PAOS package.

## v0.7.0 (2026-09-02) - codex

- [policy] [feat] [completed] Added a replayable long-horizon pick-and-place workflow
  reducer over the existing Forge Tool API. It enforces the six-step order, preserves
  opaque references and terminal state, blocks skipped/unknown/failed transitions, and
  resumes only through an append-only revision without adding a Gateway route.
- [policy] [feat] [完成] 新增基于现有 Forge Tool API 的可重放长程 pick-and-place workflow
  reducer。它固定六阶段顺序，保存 opaque 引用与终态，阻断跳步/unknown/失败迁移，
  仅通过追加 revision 恢复，不新增 Gateway 路由。

### Verification

- Added `src/scene_observe/long_horizon.py` and `tests/test_long_horizon.py`; exported
  the reducer and workflow state types and updated the manifest, package version,
  README, SKILL.md, and discovery version assertions.
- The reducer delegates all execution to the existing AgentTask/ForgeToolClient path,
  accepts only terminal statuses and opaque references, validates observation,
  candidate-set, preparation, acquire, and place bindings, and serializes a redacted
  projection with no coordinates or provider/simulator fields.
- `pytest`: 169 passed; `ruff check`, `compileall`, and `git diff --check` passed before
  this metadata-only version bump. PAOS core remains unchanged and no new motion route
  or second execution protocol was introduced.

## v0.6.0 (2026-09-01) - codex

- [policy] [feat] [completed] Added the provider-neutral `object.place` bounded Action.
  It requires a terminal successful acquire invocation, preserves immutable scene and
  candidate bindings, keeps transport/descent/release/retreat internal, and reports
  typed post-release evidence in the redacted `capability_outcome_summary_v1`.
- [policy] [feat] [完成] 新增 provider-neutral `object.place` bounded Action：要求引用已终态
  成功的 acquire invocation，保持场景与候选不可变绑定，transport/descent/release/retreat
  保持 Gateway 内部，并在脱敏的 `capability_outcome_summary_v1` 中返回类型化释放后证据。

### Verification

- Added `contracts/object.place.tool.yaml`, `src/scene_observe/object_place.py`, and
  `tests/test_object_place.py`; updated Fake Gateway routing, per-tool concurrency,
  Bundle manifest, package version, README, SKILL.md, and discovery assertions.
- Admission rejects stale, missing-calibration, malformed, unbound, unavailable, and
  non-terminal or unsuccessful acquire references before placement invocation identity
  allocation. Standard status/result and cancel routes preserve pending, terminal,
  cancellation, and unknown semantics.
- Public inputs contain only provider-neutral references and an opaque destination;
  no RoboTwin, simulator, provider-private, coordinate, or internal-phase fields are
  exposed. PAOS core remains unchanged and all tests remain no-motion fixtures.

## v0.5.0 (2026-09-01) - codex

- [policy] [feat] [completed] Added the provider-neutral `object.acquire` bounded Action.
  It consumes a fresh preparation/candidate binding through standard Action admission,
  keeps approach/contact/close/lift/hold internal, and exposes a redacted,
  versioned `capability_outcome_summary_v1` only in terminal results.
- [policy] [feat] [完成] 新增 provider-neutral `object.acquire` bounded Action，通过标准
  Action admission 消费新鲜的 preparation/candidate 绑定；approach/contact/close/lift/hold
  保持 Gateway 内部阶段，仅在终态返回脱敏、版本化的 `capability_outcome_summary_v1`。

### Verification

- Added `contracts/object.acquire.tool.yaml`, `src/scene_observe/object_acquire.py`,
  and Action lifecycle coverage in `tests/test_object_acquire.py`; updated Fake Gateway,
  manifest, package version, README, SKILL.md, and discovery assertions.
- Admission rejects stale, missing-calibration, malformed, unbound, unavailable, and
  over-concurrency requests before invocation identity allocation. Standard status/result
  and cancel routes preserve pending, terminal, cancellation, and unknown semantics.
- No RoboTwin, simulator, provider-private, coordinate, or direct Agent-to-backend fields
  are included in the public contract; PAOS core remains unchanged.

## v0.4.0 (2026-09-01) - codex

- [sense] [feat] [completed] Added the provider-neutral `manipulation.prepare` Query
  for non-mutating workspace, kinematic, and collision readiness assessment over a
  bound `grasp.propose` candidate set. It returns per-candidate pass evidence,
  explicit empty/stale/unavailable/invalid states, and a deterministic preparation
  reference while keeping `motion_authorized=false` and exposing no Action or Session.
- [sense] [feat] [完成] 新增 provider-neutral `manipulation.prepare` Query，对绑定的
  `grasp.propose` 候选集执行非侵入式 workspace、kinematic、collision 准备评估。
  它返回逐候选通过证据、明确的 empty/stale/unavailable/invalid 状态和确定性
  preparation 引用，同时保持 `motion_authorized=false`，不暴露 Action 或 Session。

### Verification

- Added `contracts/manipulation.prepare.tool.yaml`,
  `src/scene_observe/manipulation_prepare.py`, and
  `tests/test_manipulation_prepare.py`; updated the Fake Gateway, Bundle manifest,
  README, SKILL.md, and package version.
- Inputs are strictly bound to one observation, scene revision, frame, calibration,
  freshness window, candidate-set reference, and provider-neutral candidates. Stale
  observations and missing calibration fail closed before the provider runs; empty
  candidates do not invoke the provider or fabricate preparation.
- Provider snapshots are checked for candidate/entity binding, exact fields, artifact
  provenance, and all three checks being `pass` before a candidate is marked prepared.
  Query output always contains `motion_authorized: false`.
- Tests exercise the real PAOS `ForgeToolClient` through the Fake Gateway and prove
  that preparation creates no Action, Session, invocation-status, or motion route.
- The package initializer now exports the preparation endpoint, provider protocol,
  snapshot, and ToolSpec; README and manifest descriptions cover all four Query
  capabilities and their provider-neutral adapter boundary.

## v0.3.0 (2026-09-01) - codex

- [sense] [feat] [completed] Added the provider-neutral `grasp.propose` Query as the third
  capability on a separate branch. It converts one verified scene understanding result into
  a generic grasp candidate set with candidate identity, frame/calibration binding,
  provenance, confidence/score, bounded funnel evidence, and explicit empty-candidate
  semantics while staying synchronous, read-only, and free of IK, planning, collision
  checking, Actions, Sessions, and motion authorization.
- [sense] [feat] [完成] 在独立分支上新增 provider-neutral `grasp.propose` Query 作为第三个能力。
  它把一个已验证的 scene understanding 结果转换为带候选身份、frame/calibration 绑定、
  provenance、置信度/评分、有界漏斗证据和明确空候选语义的通用抓取候选集；保持同步只读，
  不包含 IK、规划、碰撞检测、Action、Session 或运动授权。

### Verification

- Added `contracts/grasp.propose.tool.yaml`, `src/scene_observe/grasp_proposal.py`, and
  `tests/test_grasp_propose.py`; updated the Fake Gateway routes, Bundle manifest, and
  workflow guidance.
- Input requires the named observation reference, scene revision, frame, calibration,
  freshness, `max_age_ms`, and observation-bound targets. Stale and missing-calibration
  inputs fail closed before the provider runs; an empty target list returns `status=empty`
  without fabricated candidates.
- Output preserves `candidate_set_ref`, per-candidate identity/frame/provenance, reconciled
  funnel counts, and ambiguity evidence. Qualification is limited to `proposed`,
  `low_confidence`, and `ambiguous`; no field expresses IK success, collision clearance,
  reachability, or action admission, and `motion_authorized` stays `false`.
- The Fake Gateway advertises all three Query specs, reflects grasp-provider availability
  in the `grasp.propose` context, and fails closed when the provider is not configured.
- Tests use PAOS's real `ForgeToolClient.invoke_query_tool("grasp.propose", ...)` through the
  documented Gateway routes and prove no Action, Session, invocation, or motion route exists.

## v0.1.0 (2026-09-01) - codex

- [sense] [feat] Provider-neutral `scene.observe` Query contract, endpoint interface,
  no-motion Fake Gateway transport, and PAOS ForgeToolClient conformance tests.

## v0.1.1 (2026-09-01) - codex

- [sense] [fix] [completed] Added the named `observation_ref` required by the PAOS
  perception architecture so downstream Query capabilities can bind to one immutable
  observation without importing a provider or simulator.
- [sense] [fix] [完成] 增加 PAOS 感知架构要求的命名 `observation_ref`，使下游 Query
  能绑定一个不可变观测，而无需导入 provider 或仿真器。

### Verification

- `scene.observe` ToolSpec/output now requires `observation_ref` with the
  `observation://<scene_revision>/<frame>` shape.
- `pytest`: 7 passed; `ruff check`: passed; `compileall`: passed.
- Changed files: `contracts/scene.observe.tool.yaml`,
  `src/scene_observe/fake_gateway.py`, `tests/test_scene_observe.py`.

## v0.2.0 (2026-09-01) - codex

- [sense] [feat] [completed] Added the provider-neutral `scene.understand` Query as a
  separate capability branch. It will consume one named observation, preserve
  provenance/frame/calibration bindings, and return entity claims, relations,
  spatial envelopes, confidence, and ambiguity without motion or provider fields.
- [sense] [feat] [完成] 新增 provider-neutral `scene.understand` Query 独立能力分支。
  它将消费一个命名观测，保留 provenance/frame/calibration 绑定，并返回实体声明、关系、
  空间包络、置信度和歧义信息；不包含运动或 provider 字段。

### Verification

- Added `contracts/scene.understand.tool.yaml`, `src/scene_observe/understanding.py`,
  and `tests/test_scene_understand.py`; updated the Bundle manifest, workflow guidance,
  and Fake Gateway routes.
- Input requires the named observation reference, scene revision, frame, calibration,
  freshness, and artifact references. Output preserves entity/relation/spatial provenance
  and confidence while keeping `motion_authorized=false`.
- `pytest`: 13 passed; `ruff check`: passed; `compileall`: passed; Bundle archive
  validation passed (SHA-256 `d1766c1965e6b6dd664d4a5b08d79719e3826855e7b99a0f8d71e2373f912f20`, 12839 bytes).
- Fake Gateway advertises both Query specs while reflecting understanding-provider
  availability in the `scene.understand` context; unavailable providers remain fail-closed.
- [sense] [feat] Provider-neutral `scene.observe` Query contract, endpoint interface,
  no-motion Fake Gateway transport, and PAOS ForgeToolClient conformance tests.
