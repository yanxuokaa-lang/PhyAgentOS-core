# RoboTwin20 EnvironmentAdapter

This is an independently installable adapter workspace. It is not part of the
`PhyAgentOS` wheel and must not be installed into the PAOS control-plane
environment. The base adapter package has no third-party dependency; optional
OpenAI and perception dependencies are installed only in adapter/provider
environments. A deployment-specific backend is installed in a separate
RoboTwin runtime environment and injected through the `RoboTwinSensorBackend`
protocol.

RoboTwin/SAPIEN packages, Torch/YOLO models, simulator assets, task files,
embodiment configuration, and benchmark data stay outside PAOS and outside this
source bundle. A profile should pass an external asset root to the backend; this
adapter never copies or imports those assets and never reads actor/entity truth,
segmentation truth, internal poses, or simulator success checks.

The only public observation seam is camera/depth/state sensor output with a
timezone-aware timestamp, scene revision, frame, calibration reference, and
typed artifact references. Missing calibration or any required sensor kind is a
hard failure. The adapter is no-motion: it provides environment lifecycle and
observation only; action providers remain a later, separately reviewed seam.

Example isolated setup:

```text
paos                           # ToolSpec/Gateway/generic validation only
paos-robotwin20-adapter        # composition, artifact IO, process clients
RoboTwin20                     # simulator and RGB/depth/state capture only
hephaestus-locateanything      # LocateAnything/Torch/Transformers worker env
seg                            # SAM2/Torch worker env
robotwin-assets                # external assets, mounted by profile
```

Run the fail-closed runtime preflight before implementing or starting a
provider backend:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20/src \
python -m robotwin20_adapter.preflight \
  --runtime-root /home/yanxu/robotwin20-runtime/RoboTwin \
  --runtime-python /home/yanxu/miniconda3/envs/RoboTwin20/bin/python
```

The check validates the external source layout, all three official asset
families, embodiment configuration, full runtime modules, editable XPolicyLab
installation, a real Torch CUDA kernel, Vulkan device discovery, SAPIEN scene
creation, and task-class import. It deliberately does not call `setup_demo`,
`play_once`, `check_success`, or any robot/action method. A nonzero exit means
the RoboTwin provider must remain unavailable.

After preflight passes, run the runtime-only sensor backend from the RoboTwin20
environment. Its artifact root must be external to PAOS and Hephaestus:

```bash
cd /home/yanxu/PhyAgentOS-forge
PYTHONPATH=examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20/src \
/home/yanxu/miniconda3/envs/RoboTwin20/bin/python \
examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20/runtime/robotwin_backend.py \
  --runtime-root /home/yanxu/robotwin20-runtime/RoboTwin \
  --artifact-root /home/yanxu/robotwin20-runtime/artifacts \
  --forbidden-root /home/yanxu/PhyAgentOS-forge \
  --sensor-ref camera/head \
  --seed 0
```

To emit the exact provider-neutral snapshot consumed by the `scene.observe`
ToolEndpoint, use `--format scene_observe`. This command is intended to run in
the Python 3.10 RoboTwin process; PAOS (Python 3.11+) consumes the JSON through
the Gateway/provider boundary and must not import RoboTwin modules directly:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20/src \
/home/yanxu/miniconda3/envs/RoboTwin20/bin/python \
examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20/runtime/robotwin_backend.py \
  --runtime-root /home/yanxu/robotwin20-runtime/RoboTwin \
  --artifact-root /home/yanxu/robotwin20-runtime/artifacts \
  --forbidden-root /home/yanxu/PhyAgentOS-forge \
  --sensor-ref camera/head \
  --seed 0 \
  --format scene_observe
```

The snapshot fields are the same ones returned by
`ForgeToolClient.invoke_query_tool("scene.observe", ...)` through the Fake
Gateway: observation identity, timestamp, scene revision, frame, calibration,
freshness, and typed artifact references. Runtime warnings may be emitted by
third-party renderers; the JSON object is the provider payload, not simulator
truth.

The next `scene.understand` seam is exposed as
`RoboTwinSceneUnderstandingProvider`. It accepts an injected inference service
and forwards only the observation identity plus artifact references. The
adapter does not ship a detector/VLM and rejects provider-specific result
fields; the generic `scene.understand` endpoint owns the public ToolSpec
projection and fail-closed error semantics.

For a real GPT-backed inference deployment, install the optional provider
dependency in the adapter/provider environment only:

```bash
python -m pip install -e 'examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20[openai]'
export CUSTOM_API_KEY='(set outside the repository)'
```

Construct `OpenAIResponsesSceneUnderstandingInference` with an injected
`FilesystemArtifactResolver('/external/artifacts')` (or another resolver
implementing the same port) and wrap it with
`RoboTwinSceneUnderstandingProvider`. The
default configuration follows the existing Hephaestus relay format
(`gpt-5.6-sol`, Responses API, `https://api.shuaiapi.com/v1`) but is owned by
this adapter and can be overridden through `OpenAIResponsesConfig`. The API
key is read at invocation time and is never persisted or sent through PAOS.
The provider emits only `entities`, `relations`, `spatial_envelopes`, and
`ambiguities`; PAOS performs the final contract validation, including binding
each claim's provenance to an artifact in the requested observation, and
projects the result through the same Gateway endpoint used by the Fake path.

The perception boundary is intentionally split by PAOS use case:

| Capability | ToolSpec | Adapter/provider responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Object recognition/detection | `scene.understand` | Infer entities from RGB or other observation artifacts; never read simulator actor truth. |
| Instance segmentation | `scene.understand` | Produce an opaque, provenance-bound mask artifact through a replaceable provider. |
| Metric 3D localization | `scene.understand` | Combine depth, calibration, frame transforms, and masks; fail closed when any input is missing. |
| Grasp pose proposal | `grasp.propose` | Emit candidate poses and provenance only; it does not authorize motion. |
| IK/collision/workspace readiness | `manipulation.prepare` | Evaluate candidates before any bounded Action. |

The GPT Responses provider covers RGB semantic recognition and relations. The
adapter now also contains a single-view composition that binds each semantic
entity to a LocateAnything proposal, releases that model process, invokes SAM2
with the exact box, and deterministically localizes the mask with aligned depth
and calibration. It materializes provider-neutral `instance_mask`,
`object_point_cloud`, and `metric_localization` records through the existing
`scene.understand` contract. The adapter also exposes a separate
`GraspGenProposalProvider`: it consumes an explicitly bound object point-cloud
or fused-entity artifact and returns provider-neutral candidate poses through
`grasp.propose`; it never performs IK, collision admission, or motion and does
not fold any provider into `scene.observe` or a RoboTwin-named Skill.

The perception models retain their existing isolated environments. Configure
them through the adapter profile without importing either environment into
PAOS or RoboTwin20:

```bash
export PAOS_ROBOTWIN20_ADAPTER_ROOT=/home/yanxu/PhyAgentOS-forge/examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20
export ROBOTWIN20_ARTIFACT_ROOT=/home/yanxu/robotwin20-runtime/artifacts
export LOCATEANYTHING_PYTHON=/home/yanxu/.hephaestus/envs/hephaestus-locateanything/bin/python
export LOCATEANYTHING_CACHE_DIR=/home/yanxu/.hephaestus/cache/huggingface/hub
export LOCATEANYTHING_MODULES_CACHE_DIR=/home/yanxu/.hephaestus/cache/huggingface/modules
export SAM2_PYTHON=/home/yanxu/miniconda3/envs/seg/bin/python
export SAM2_REPO_ROOT=/home/yanxu/Grounded-SAM-2
export SAM2_CHECKPOINT=/home/yanxu/Grounded-SAM-2/checkpoints/sam2.1_hiera_large.pt
```

Load `profiles/robotwin20/perception.yaml`, then pass the mapping and the
semantic inference provider to `build_single_view_perception`. Inject the
resulting inference object into `RoboTwinSceneUnderstandingProvider`; PAOS
continues to call it only through the generic Gateway endpoint. Worker startup,
request, shutdown, model revision, checkpoint, device, and timeout settings are
profile-owned. Commands never use a shell. The proposal process exits before
the SAM2 process starts, so the two existing model environments remain
independently replaceable.

The shipped unit/conformance path remains reproducible with fake model workers.
A no-motion live run has also exercised the configured LocateAnything revision
and SAM2 checkpoint against an existing `320x240` RoboTwin RGB-D observation.
LocateAnything returned one `red block` proposal, SAM2 materialized an aligned
mask, and the complete Fake Gateway route returned all three derived artifacts
plus a camera-frame metric envelope with `motion_authorized=false`. The run used
a fixed semantic entity as composition input; it was not a fresh GPT invocation
and does not validate grasp proposal or execution. Both model processes exited
after their bounded stage and no worker remained resident.

The grasp provider is configured independently through
`profiles/robotwin20/graspgen.yaml`. Its worker receives only an adapter-resolved
point-cloud path and returns 4x4 matrices plus scores; the adapter validates the
homogeneous transform, converts it to a normalized quaternion and approach
vector, applies deterministic confidence-ordered SE(3) NMS, and projects the
candidate funnel. GraspGen/Torch/checkpoint settings remain in the external
worker profile. The repository currently contains the worker protocol and
conformance tests, but no local GraspGen checkpoint is assumed; until the
profile points at a verified external model environment the provider must stay
`unavailable` rather than fabricate candidates.

Although this reference wiring lives beside the RoboTwin adapter example, the
provider itself depends only on the generic `PointCloudArtifactResolver` and
`GraspWorkerClient` ports. A future hardware or replay adapter can reuse the
same provider with its own artifact resolver/profile; no RoboTwin or SAPIEN
object is part of the provider API.

The adapter also exposes `RoboTwinReadinessEvaluator` as the independent seam
for `manipulation.prepare`. It accepts the frozen observation/candidate request
and delegates to an injected no-motion evaluator, such as a separately
provisioned IK/collision/workspace worker. It returns only prepared candidates,
three passing readiness checks, and opaque evidence references. Invalid or
unbound candidates, unknown/failing checks, duplicate references, provider
specific fields, and evaluator failures remain fail-closed at the PAOS endpoint.
The evaluator never imports PAOS, RoboTwin, SAPIEN, Hephaestus, or an actuator,
and never authorizes motion. A real evaluator must be profile-owned and
independently conformance-tested before any Action provider is considered.

For deterministic no-motion conformance, `profiles/robotwin20/readiness-replay.yaml`
builds the same evaluator through `readiness_replay_worker.py` and the existing
JSONL process client. Set `READINESS_FIXTURE`, its exact
`READINESS_FIXTURE_SHA256`, `READINESS_EVIDENCE_MANIFEST`,
`READINESS_EVIDENCE_MANIFEST_SHA256`, `READINESS_WORKER_PYTHON`, and
`PAOS_ROBOTWIN20_ADAPTER_ROOT` in the deployment environment. Also set
`ROBOTWIN20_RUNTIME_PROFILE` to the absolute, read-only runtime profile file;
its SHA-256 must equal `embodiment_binding.profile_digest`. The fixture and
evidence manifest must be external regular files with no group/world write bits.
The worker matches the complete observation/candidate identity and validates
each evidence reference against the manifest's revision, frame, calibration,
source, and timezone-aware capture timestamp before returning replay evidence;
unknown cases, digest/path/schema mismatches, worker identity changes, missing
or drifted evidence, and non-no-motion responses fail closed. Replay is protocol
evidence only, not a claim of real IK, collision, trajectory, or physical success.

Once a real or independently validated worker result has been manually reviewed,
`ReadinessReplayClient.record_replay(request, absolute_path)` can persist the
validated projection as an immutable adapter-local canonical JSON artifact. The
artifact carries worker, fixture, evidence-manifest, request, result, and
timezone-aware generation bindings plus a SHA-256 content ID. Existing files may
only be replayed when the bytes are identical; divergent overwrites, malformed
JSON, path/symlink or permission violations, request/result drift, and any
`motion_authorized=true` value fail closed. This artifact is an audit/replay
record, not a PAOS `EvidenceBundle`, physical-success verdict, or Action/Gateway
admission. The manual-review gate remains a prerequisite for real wiring.

The first end-to-end no-motion run across the currently configured providers
is recorded under
`/home/yanxu/robotwin20-runtime/artifacts/paos-real-chain-20260905T0020Z/`.
It binds RoboTwin `beat_block_hammer/demo_clean`, seed `0`, and
`aloha-agilex`. The run manifest records preflight, scene observation, real
`gpt-5.6-sol` scene understanding, LocateAnything/SAM2/RGB-D derived
artifacts, profile digests, source/derived artifact hashes, and raw worker
stdout/stderr. The first three stages passed; GraspGen and readiness are
explicitly unavailable because their required profile environment variables are
not configured. No Action, Dora, or motion stage was attempted.

The next provider-gated run restored the external GraspGen profile and
replayed the real `entity://red-rectangular-block-1` point cloud through
`GraspGenProposalProvider` without motion. It returned 24 normalized,
provider-neutral candidates with funnel `24/24/24/24`. Evidence is stored at
`/home/yanxu/robotwin20-runtime/artifacts/paos-graspgen-live-20260905T0040Z/`;
the manifest SHA-256 is
`a7627a6d8583bf4da502dfe1deaf8c3ec1e978f8f274ede545446614f43ae336`.
The worker keeps JSONL on stdout and routes model logs to stderr. This is
grasp-provider evidence only; IK/collision readiness, Action/Gateway, Dora,
and physical execution remain gated.

This initializes one simulation scene and captures RGB, depth, calibration, and
joint/end-effector state artifacts. It does not call `play_once`,
`check_success`, segmentation APIs, actor/entity APIs, or any action route.

The first verified capture used `beat_block_hammer/demo_clean`, seed `0`, and
produced a `240x320` RGB PNG, a `240x320` float32 depth NPY, calibration JSON,
and state JSON under `/home/yanxu/robotwin20-runtime/artifacts`. The injected
PAOS adapter returned the three public kinds `rgb`, `depth`, and `state` with a
stable scene revision. On the RTX 5060 Ti host, SAPIEN emitted OIDN CUDA
denoiser warnings during this smoke run, but the sensor artifacts were
successfully persisted; this remains a runtime risk and is not treated as a
perception-quality claim.

### Franka and replaceable embodiment profiles

RoboTwin's embodiment is adapter/profile configuration, not a PAOS ToolSpec
field. The backend accepts either a native dual-arm name (for example
`aloha-agilex`) or RoboTwin's two-single-arm form:

```text
embodiment: [franka-panda, franka-panda, 0.8]
```

The adapter validates topology before scene setup: a one-name profile must
declare `dual_arm: true`, while a three-value profile must reference two
`dual_arm: false` configs. This prevents a single Panda from being silently
treated as a shared dual-arm robot. The first long-horizon profile is
`profiles/robotwin20/franka-blocks-ranking.yaml` (`blocks_ranking_rgb`, seed
0, head camera, Curobo). A different benchmark or robot is introduced by a
new adapter-owned profile and matching planner/gripper/readiness binding; the
public PAOS Skill, ToolSpec, task lifecycle, and Evidence schema remain
unchanged.

Readiness replay and live profiles carry an `embodiment_binding` containing robot,
gripper, topology, planner, and profile-digest values. The fixture, evidence
manifest, worker response, and immutable replay artifact must agree exactly.
Any mismatch is unavailable/fail-closed and never becomes Action admission.
For the independently provisioned Curobo worker, use
`profiles/robotwin20/readiness-live.yaml` with absolute environment paths for
the RoboTwin Python, runtime/profile/artifact roots, calibration reference, and
workspace bounds; `build_live_readiness_evaluator` routes the process through
the same bounded JSONL client and validates the live schema before PAOS
projection.

The execution order is now:

1. complete Franka profile and no-motion scene/observation for
   `blocks_ranking_rgb`;
2. obtain real or independently validated readiness-worker evidence and have
   it manually reviewed;
3. only then consider Action/Gateway no-motion wiring;
4. run RoboTwin motion simulation and later benchmark expansion
   (`stack_blocks_two`, then `stack_blocks_three`);
5. keep autonomous evolution behind attributable, independently evaluated
   execution evidence.

No Action, Gateway, Dora, or hardware motion is enabled by this profile work.

The Franka readiness gate for the first profiled scene is now complete for the
no-motion review boundary. Capture geometry and point-cloud artifacts,
GraspGen candidates, and the independent Curobo worker all bind
`blocks_ranking_rgb-0-1/head_camera` and the same calibration. The worker
prepared 50 of 71 candidates and wrote 50 unique evidence artifacts with
kinematic, collision (robot self and table only), and workspace checks passing.
The response schema is `paos-robotwin20-readiness-live/v1`; every response and
evidence artifact has `motion_authorized=false`. The manifest and manual review
are under `/home/yanxu/robotwin20-runtime/artifacts/paos-franka-blocks-ranking-v470-20260904T/`.
The manual decision authorizes only the next no-motion Action/Gateway
integration review. It does not authorize attached-object transport/contact,
RoboTwin action stepping, Dora, hardware, or physical execution.

### No-motion Action admission

Action admission is gated by the reviewed readiness evidence before a Gateway
invocation is created. Configure `profiles/robotwin20/action-readiness.yaml`:

```yaml
schema_version: paos-robotwin20-action-readiness/v1
manifest: ${ROBOTWIN20_READINESS_MANIFEST}
manual_review: ${ROBOTWIN20_READINESS_REVIEW}
artifact_root: ${ROBOTWIN20_ARTIFACT_ROOT}
```

Use `build_action_readiness_gate(...)` and pass the resulting gate to the
`object.acquire` and `object.place` endpoints. The gate verifies the review
decision, manifest/evidence digests, same-scene identity, all three readiness
checks, and `motion_authorized=false`. Rejections occur before invocation
allocation. This path is still no-motion: providers must not call
`play_once`, Dora, or hardware, and `world_change_started` remains `false`.

### Simulation-motion authorization profile (disabled)

The next-stage contract is declared separately in
`profiles/robotwin20/simulation-motion.yaml` and loaded with
`load_simulation_motion_profile(...)`. It binds the runtime profile digest to
the `blocks_ranking_rgb` Franka scene and names the five readiness scopes that
must be independently produced and reviewed before any motion request:
attached-object collision, complete transport/descent/retreat, contact
dynamics, workspace/joint limits, and stop control. It also requires explicit
unknown handling, before/after snapshot artifacts, and a separate PAOS task
Verifier handoff after execution.

The checked-in profile is deliberately `state: disabled`,
`motion_authorized: false`, and has no worker. Loading it is validation only:
it does not start RoboTwin, `play_once`, Dora, Gateway, or hardware. An
approved profile additionally needs a dedicated approval record bound to the
profile identity, an evidence-manifest SHA-256, and all evidence scopes, but that record is still not a
replacement for Gateway/Runtime action admission. The profile does not claim
that the missing readiness, contact, or task-verification evidence exists.

### Simulation route-readiness worker (unavailable by design)

`profiles/robotwin20/route-readiness.yaml` and
`robotwin_route_readiness_worker.py` define the next evidence seam. Requests
must bind the same observation/scene/candidate-set/frame, attached-object
geometry digest, and all eight phases from approach through retreat. Waypoints
carry frame, pose, linear-speed, and joint-speed limits; workspace bounds and
stop-policy references are mandatory.

The checked-in worker currently returns `status: unavailable` with explicit
`motion_authorized: false` and `world_change_started: false`. It records route
evidence artifacts but does not claim IK, attached-object collision, contact
dynamics, stop control, or semantic success. It never calls `play_once`, steps
RoboTwin, or creates a Gateway Action. A future planner/contact/verifier worker
must implement these checks under the same contract before any simulation
authorization can be reviewed.

### Independent route-evidence verifier

`route-evidence.yaml` and `robotwin_route_evidence_worker.py` provide the next
adapter-owned boundary. The worker consumes an external evidence bundle rather
than running a planner: the bundle must include a verified attached-geometry
artifact, planner trajectory and joint-limit artifacts, all five route-readiness
scope artifacts, bound before/after snapshots, and a bounded `observed_outcome`.
Every artifact is checked for SHA-256, root containment, immutability, and the
same request/candidate/scene/frame/calibration identity. Before and after
snapshots must be valid, bound JSON records with distinct state digests.

`build_route_evidence_client(...)` returns `available` only when all of those
external artifacts pass verification. The resulting projection remains
`motion_authorized: false` and `world_change_started: false`; the worker never
starts RoboTwin or creates an Action/Gateway invocation. This is an evidence
consumer, not a substitute for a real planner, simulator stepping, or manual
approval.

### Independent RoboTwin simulation probe

`simulation-probe.yaml`, `simulation_probe.py`, and `robotwin_simulation_probe_worker.py` form a separately
authorized simulation-only producer. The worker requires profile/producer/request/candidate binding and a
stop file, checks Curobo trajectories and attached-object geometry, and records phase-level SAPIEN contacts,
snapshots, failure diagnostics, and reset status. Its observed outcome is explicitly limited to one selected object;
it is not a `blocks_ranking_rgb` benchmark result or a hardware readiness claim.

The latest Franka `blocks_ranking_rgb` seed-0 run is a negative readiness result: an active
`panda_rightfinger/table` collision was found during retreat, so the worker returned `unavailable` and wrote
a failure artifact. A corrected candidate route must be run from a fresh artifact root before evidence can be
reviewed. The producer is not connected to PAOS Gateway, Dora, Action admission, or hardware, and the verifier
remains no-motion.

The stricter follow-up run at
`/home/yanxu/robotwin20-runtime/artifacts/paos-simulation-probe-20260905T1100Z` also assigns unique actor
identities, persists the before snapshot before the first simulator step, binds the actual backend revision, and
requires the target actor to rise by at least 1 cm at the end of `lift`. The real GraspGen green-block candidate
did not satisfy that physical lift invariant, so the result remains `unavailable` and the simulation was reset.
Planner attachment and contact alone are not readiness. Select or generate a candidate that physically lifts the
target, then rerun the complete route and the no-motion evidence verifier; do not proceed to motion wiring yet.

The final policy/recovery review additionally requires materialized joint-limit and stop-policy JSON artifacts.
The approval binds their SHA-256 values together with the calibration digest; the worker enforces runtime
position limits and records planner/controller observations without inventing a Cartesian speed limit. Speed
constraints must come from the provider-owned planner/controller capability artifact described in
`docs/forge/REAL_SPEED_LIMITS_ARCHITECTURE.md`. Any failure after scene reset—including planning or final
evidence persistence—produces a bound failure artifact and attempts simulator reset. Scene reset itself counts
as a world change.

The latest historical run is
`/home/yanxu/robotwin20-runtime/artifacts/paos-simulation-probe-20260905T020000p0800-policy-v6`.
It returned `unavailable` before a robot-control step: the left arm could not plan, while the right-arm trajectory
exceeded the approved `1.0 rad/s` waypoint limit. Before/after-failure snapshots and reset-completed evidence were
preserved. This is a valid negative safety result, not route readiness. Generate a policy-compliant candidate route
and prove real lift plus all remaining phases before invoking the no-motion route-evidence verifier.

### GraspGen/RoboTwin frame contract (v3)

GraspGen's `0.10527314 m` depth is materialized as `provider_T_contact_center` from
`gripper_base_link` to the canonical contact center. It is not a RoboTwin planner TCP
offset. The Franka profile then derives a separate `robot_target_pose` using the declared
RoboTwin gripper axis map, `0.12 m` target reference distance, and `0.08 m` endlink bias.
Routes and simulation preflight consume `robot_target_pose`/`object_T_robot_target`; the
canonical contact pose is retained only for contact-shell and round-trip evidence. Mixed
v2 fields (`contact_tcp_pose`, `object_T_tcp`, `release_tcp_pose`) are rejected.

The historical v5/v6 packages under
`/home/yanxu/robotwin20-runtime/artifacts/paos-route-inputs-20260905T204500Z/materialized/`.
use the retired `paos-robotwin20-route-request/v3` speed policy and are retained only as
historical evidence. They cannot be approved or replayed through the current v4 route
contract. The historical no-motion run had zero robot-control and simulator steps and is
still only planner/policy evidence;
attached-object collision, physical lift, contact dynamics, semantic placement, and
readiness approval remain unproven.

The current `paos-robotwin20-route-request/v5` binds provider-owned motion
capability artifacts for both arms and removes the unbacked waypoint
speed fields and fails closed before simulation world change until a
separately qualified controller-enforcement artifact is implemented and bound.
Human simulation approval alone does not bypass this gate.

### Isolated controller qualification

After a separate human approval of the qualification plan (and only for the
isolated simulation scope), run the provider worker with a fresh artifact root:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20/src:examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20/runtime \
python examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20/scripts/run_controller_qualification.py \
  --plan /abs/qualification_plan.json \
  --approval /abs/approval.json \
  --plan-validation /abs/no_motion_validation.json \
  --source-manifest /abs/source_manifest.json \
  --left-capability /abs/left-motion-capability.json \
  --left-validation /abs/left-motion-capability-validation.json \
  --right-capability /abs/right-motion-capability.json \
  --right-validation /abs/right-motion-capability-validation.json \
  --artifact-root /abs/new-qualification-artifacts \
  --robotwin-root /abs/RoboTwin \
  --stop-file /abs/new-qualification-artifacts/STOP
```

The worker never loads a benchmark task and refuses non-isolated plans. It
rechecks all approval-bound file digests before every SAPIEN step. Then run
`validate_controller_qualification_evidence.py` against the generated
evidence. Missing SAPIEN, unsupported contact/error fixtures, stale inputs,
and incomplete traces produce `unavailable`/`validated_failure`; they cannot
be converted into a controller limit or route approval.

The current native RoboTwin drive-target identity is intentionally not
qualified. The adapter also provides a separate
`paos-robotwin-capability-bounded-drive-target` controller boundary. It must be
materialized and independently validated as a new capability source; its
qualification plan requires a fresh human approval because controller identity
and source digest are part of the approval binding.

Materialize and independently revalidate one provider-owned capability without
loading a scene or executing motion:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20/src \
python examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20/scripts/materialize_motion_capability.py \
  --robotwin-root /absolute/path/to/RoboTwin \
  --runtime-python /absolute/path/to/robotwin/python \
  --embodiment franka-panda --arm left \
  --output /new/absolute/artifact-root/left-motion-capability.json

PYTHONPATH=examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20/src \
python examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20/scripts/verify_motion_capability.py \
  --capability /new/absolute/artifact-root/left-motion-capability.json \
  --robotwin-root /absolute/path/to/RoboTwin \
  --runtime-python /absolute/path/to/robotwin/python \
  --verifier-id paos-source-validator-v1 \
  --output /new/absolute/artifact-root/left-motion-capability-validation.json
```

Repeat for `--arm right` and pass all four files to
`materialize_complete_route.py`. Validation/v1 reports
`validated_planner_constraints`; it intentionally keeps
`independent_execution_qualification=false`, `controller_enforced=false`, and
`motion_authorized=false`.
The simulation probe now uses the qualified bounded controller as its only route execution
boundary. It verifies the imported source digest and version against MotionCapability before
the first step and on every step. Trajectory commands settle through
`command -> before_step -> scene.step -> after_step`; gripper phases issue a qualified
zero-velocity arm hold. Native controller, changed source, stale approval, input digest drift,
or normalized gripper values outside `[0, 1]` fail closed. This remains simulation-only and
never grants PAOS Gateway, benchmark, or hardware motion authority.

### Persistent Tool host development deployment

`profiles/forge-persistent/` runs the existing seven Tool endpoints behind one
Gateway-compatible HTTP transport while retaining one RoboTwin worker and world for the
host process lifetime. Startup sends one read-only `snapshot` to create and validate the
world. It does not create an Action or issue motion. `object.acquire` and `object.place`
remain subject to their existing preparation, approval, ownership, and Runtime admission.

Set the deployment-owned paths and provider configuration before starting the development
flow:

```bash
export PAOS_ROBOTWIN20_FORGE_ROOT=/home/yanxu/PhyAgentOS-forge
export PAOS_ROBOTWIN20_ADAPTER_ROOT="$PAOS_ROBOTWIN20_FORGE_ROOT/examples/forge-adapters/robotwin20"

The perception, GraspGen, route, controller-qualification, and motion-capability variables
referenced by those profiles must also be set. Then run from the development profile
directory:

```bash
cd "$PAOS_ROBOTWIN20_ADAPTER_ROOT/profiles/forge-persistent"
dora run dataflow.yaml
```

The HTTP Tool API listens on `127.0.0.1:19020`; `GET /tools` is the readiness probe. A
lost worker connection changes newly discovered/admitted Tool context to `ready=false`.
The host serializes HTTP dispatch because all endpoints share the same world. SIGINT or
SIGTERM closes both the HTTP server and the persistent worker.

This is an adapter-owned source-tree deployment template, not a published manifest-v2
Skill profile. The pick-place Bundle must not reference it until a self-contained,
immutable `robotwin20_persistent_host` Node artifact has been built and published. The
controlled integration tests exercise the full AgentTask/Action/Verifier protocol with a
deterministic persistent worker seam; they do not run model inference, RoboTwin motion, or
hardware.
