# Changelog

All notable changes to PhyAgentOS are documented here. Categories follow Keep a Changelog.

## [v1.0.1] - 2026-09-02

Reorganized project architecture guidance around the PAOS v1.0 Forge contracts.

### Added

- Added supplemental Forge v1.0 integration principles, Hephaestus evolution boundary, and
  contribution/drift-control documents.
- Added links to the supplemental architecture decisions from the bilingual documentation index.

### Changed

- Reframed historical Session/Target/Verifier terminology as migration context for
  ToolEndpoint, ToolSpec, Skill Bundle, AgentTask, Verification, and ExperienceCoordinator.

### Security

- Documentation-only change. No legacy Runtime code, second execution protocol, direct simulator
  path, or motion authority was introduced.

## [v1.0.0] - 2026-08-30

Initial stable release of PhyAgentOS.

### Security

- Upgraded `@whiskeysockets/baileys` to `7.0.0-rc14` to address
  `CVE-2026-48063` / `GHSA-qvv5-jq5g-4cgg`, and locked the Bridge dependency graph.

## [v0.2.3] - 2026-08-27

PhyAgentOS can run independently distributed Forge Skills through a task-scoped, immutable
Skill/Runtime/ToolSpec binding while keeping Gateway as the execution authority.

### Added

- Added first-class Query, Action, and Session Tool API lifecycles, including Session ownership,
  status/result reconciliation, and owned stop behavior.
- Added activation-time binding previews and task-time frozen bindings containing exact Skill
  version, manifest and workflow hashes, Runtime/Gateway identity, ToolSpec hashes, and Node locks.
- Added crash recovery that reconciles persisted invocation IDs using reads only, plus
  version-scoped Forge experience and Lessons.
- Added deterministic Skill bundle packaging and exact single-executable Node archive locks.
- Added the optional Bundle startup hook
  `bash <bundle>/start.sh <skill-name> <skill-version>` and supplies `PAOS_SKILL_NAME` and
  `PAOS_SKILL_VERSION` to rendered dataflows and Dora process environments.

### Changed

- Forge Gateway selection now comes only from one explicitly started, healthy installed Skill
  Runtime; static `forge.enabled`, `forge.baseUrl`, and `forge.apiVersion` selectors are rejected.
- Runtime state uses schema v2 so Runtime/Gateway identities, Session references, task bindings,
  and force-stop audit records are mandatory and stable across restarts.
- Action admission persists a PAOS-generated caller ID and intent before the remote request.
  Timeouts and unknown results cannot trigger an automatic POST retry.
- Runtime stop and switching account for active invocations, Sessions, and task bindings; forced
  stop records an audit event.
- Resource Registry Skill lookup uses the name endpoint. `paos skill install --version` validates
  the downloaded manifest as a client-side constraint before Node resolution and installation
  commit; schema-v3 static indexes retain version selection.
- Runtime environment identity now covers the selected dataflow path and profile file digests, so
  configuration edits and dataflow-path changes rematerialize the environment.
- Expanded the bilingual integration guide with Bundle packaging, local validation, immutable
  Node/Bundle publication order, and Registry acceptance guidance.

### Fixed

- Forge Node downloads accept Registry responses that omit duplicate digest and size fields. The
  verified Skill lock remains the digest authority, while the direct-download endpoint supplies
  the content length before the archive is downloaded and checked.
- Documented the Dora CLI v0.4.1 and `dora-message` v0.7.0 Forge Skill compatibility baseline,
  version-pinned installation methods, PATH and lifecycle checks, and RuntimeManager's automatic
  local Dora service startup.
- Startup-hook failures, missing Bash, and execution errors now persist a `failed` lifecycle state
  and diagnostic log before Dora can start, rather than leaving stale or unstarted state.
- Start, stop, install/update commit, and removal now use a non-blocking cross-process lock per
  Skill, preventing overlapping lifecycle mutations while allowing automatic release on process
  exit.

### Removed

- Removed the concrete Forge Skill, simulation profile, and remote bundle-fetch helper from the
  PhyAgentOS distribution. Forge Skills and their nodes, models, and assets are installed
  independently when required.

### Security

- Skill and Node downloads require exact size and SHA-256 metadata, archive extraction remains
  bounded and link-safe, and mutations require task ownership plus live binding revalidation.
- Unknown remote effects retain Runtime safety guards until explicit operator resolution.

## [v0.2.2] - 2026-08-21

PhyAgentOS now uses one Forge Query/Action Tool API execution plane while retaining Agent verification, experience, evolution, and the existing general-purpose tool platform.

### Added

- Added the AgentTask lifecycle tools `forge_task_create`, `forge_task_get`, `forge_task_begin_revision`, `forge_task_finalize`, and `forge_task_cancel` with one global non-terminal task, immutable PlanRevisions, bound Query records, Action invocation references, evidence, and aggregate verification.
- Added the Forge Tool API tools `forge_tool_context`, `forge_tool_query`, `forge_tool_start_action`, `forge_tool_action_status`, `forge_tool_action_result`, and `forge_tool_cancel_action` for bound and unbound Query/Action calls.
- Added the manifest-v2 Skill Runtime, catalog, archive validation, transactional installation, persistent runtime state, Resource Registry support, and `paos skill` / `paos forge-node` lifecycle commands.
- Added the built-in `move-arm-by-ee` v0.2 Skill with a MuJoCo profile, relative-pose Query, motion Action, gripper Action, ToolSpecs, and independently locked Forge nodes.
- Added backward-compatible AgentTask, PlanRevision, ToolInvocation, and attempt references to task experience and evolution records.

### Changed

- Robot execution now follows `AgentTask-bound or unbound call → ForgeToolClient → Gateway /tools → ToolInvocation → ToolEndpoint → Dora/robot`; operation `max_concurrency` remains the execution concurrency authority.
- Task verification now aggregates all calls bound to one AgentTask. A recovery verdict appends a bounded PlanRevision to the same task and continues through the existing verification and evolution policies.
- Skill discovery now combines workspace, installed, and built-in Skills. A healthy active Runtime contributes availability and its manifest `gateway_url` takes precedence over `forge.baseUrl`.
- `ForgeConfig` now represents `forge-tool-api.v1`; Resource Registry configuration is available through `resourceRegistry.url` or `PAOS_RESOURCE_REGISTRY_URL` and never triggers an implicit unconfigured download.
- Existing Agent tools, dynamic MCP tools, verification contracts, experience storage, evolution storage, and Skill activation remain available with their existing contracts.

### Removed

- Removed the PAOS Forge Session execution path and the seven Session-specific Agent tools: `forge_execute_task`, `forge_get_session`, `forge_cancel_session`, `forge_get_context`, `forge_reset`, `verify_forge_session`, and `create_replanned_forge_session`.
- Removed the built-in `pipergo2-demo`; `move-arm-by-ee` is the maintained robot Skill example.

### Fixed

- Cancellation acceptance, local timeout, and `unknown` invocation outcomes no longer imply that physical execution stopped and do not trigger blind retries.
- Skill and node installation now verifies SHA-256 metadata, blocks path traversal and unsafe links, validates locked node digests, and rolls back incomplete replacements.

### Security

- Runtime artifacts require verified size and digest metadata before installation; archive extraction is bounded and atomic, and no Registry download occurs without explicit configuration.

## [v0.2.1] - 2026-08-14

PhyAgentOS can turn verified Forge task outcomes into scoped, auditable workflow experience and supply activated Skill Lessons to verification as bounded, non-authoritative advice without changing the Forge execution path.

### Added

- Added explicit `activate_skill(name, role)` activation with one primary Skill, optional supporting Skills, applicable scoped Lessons, and task-to-Skill attribution.
- Added versioned task-outcome, episode, assessment, Skill candidate, failure observation, Lesson cluster, abstraction-validation, and scoped-Lesson contracts.
- Added a crash-safe SQLite WAL experience ledger, asynchronous reflection jobs, structured evolution events, Skill revision history, and generated per-Skill Lesson projections.
- Added guarded Skill creation/update after independent semantic-success support, including managed workflow blocks, workspace overrides for built-in Skills, reload validation, atomic writes, and rollback.
- Added workflow-related failure eligibility, normalized observation clustering, independent root-lineage support, Lesson synthesis, and abstraction validation.

### Changed

- Skill summaries now direct the Agent to activate a matching workflow before tool execution when evolution is enabled; direct `SKILL.md` reads are not treated as activation.
- Learned Lessons are loaded dynamically with the activated Skill. The root `LESSONS.md` remains available as legacy/human-authored material but is no longer injected globally while evolution is enabled.
- Forge verification uses the active scoped Lessons frozen with the root task's explicit Skill activations. Evolution mode never reads root `LESSONS.md` for automatic verification or review, and tasks without an activated Skill receive no learned Lesson context.
- Verifier prompts treat Lessons as untrusted, non-authoritative workflow advice that cannot establish criterion status, replace execution evidence, or appear as evidence references.
- Failures caused by unsatisfiable tasks, verifier/evidence limits, infrastructure, user constraints, or uncertain attribution remain diagnostic-only.
- Built-in Skills remain immutable; promoted revisions are written as workspace overrides and only the PAOS-managed workflow block is replaced on later updates.

### Security

- Experience records redact endpoint-, credential-, path-, executable-ID-, and action-assignment-shaped data and persist only workflow structure, input field names, opaque evidence references, and immutable record references.
- Lesson and Skill policies reject task-specific answers, fixed coordinates/values, credentials, endpoints, Gateway IDs, Action Manifest copies, prompt injection, and instructions that bypass Forge or verification.
